It is critical that component parts be appropriately rated for the materials, pressures, temperatures, and other conditions experienced during operation of the system in which they are a part. Don’t rely solely on a manufacturer to provide appropriately rated materials and components. Verify components and their specifications as early in the design or procurement process as possible. Manufacturer-provided literature (brochures, instruction manuals, bills of materials, etc.) may not always identify the specific materials for each component, so verification may require Internet research or contacting the manufacturer to obtain the necessary information or certification. (Reference https://h2tools.org/tech-ref/technical-reference-for-hydrogen-compatibi…)
作为氢气系统设备采购流程的一部分,维持一个内部流程,以验证组件润湿材料与预期用途的兼容性。至关重要的是,部件必须针对其所在系统运行期间的材料,压力,温度和其他条件进行适当的额定。不要仅仅依靠制造商提供适当额定的材料和部件。在设计或采购过程中,应尽早核实组件及其规格。制造商提供的资料（宣传册,使用手册,材料清单等）可能并不总能确定每个组件的具体材料,因此可能需要通过互联网研究或联系制造商来获得必要的信息或认证。(参考 https://h2tools. org/tech-ref/technical-reference-for-hydrogen-compatibi...）。","The sensing diaphragm of a pressure transducer (PT), as supplied on an outdoor hydrogen compressor, unexpectedly ruptured and released approximately 0.1 kilograms hydrogen to atmosphere from the compressor discharge line. At time of incident, personnel nearby were alerted by a loud 'pop' and dust disturbance. Simultaneously, the facility monitoring system detected loss of the PT signal and initiated equipment shutdown. Facility personnel then closed isolation hand valves to stop the leak, locked and tagged out the equipment, and restricted the area. The failed component, a cigar type PT rated to 20,000 psi, originally supplied and installed by the manufacturer as part of the compressor package, was removed and inspected. Inspection revealed severed wires, a separated wire housing, missing electronics and damaged electrical potting. The PT was on a line protected by a pressure safety valve set to 15,400 psi.

Facility investigators later discovered that the failed discharge PT was manufactured with a 17-4PH stainless steel diaphragm. This type of stainless steel, while an industry standard for high pressure resistance with other materials, is known in industry to be incompatible with hydrogen. The compressor manufacturer's supplied documentation generally claimed use of materials resistant to effects of H2 embrittlement at expected operating conditions, but did not identify the specific materials of internal components such as PT diaphragms. The facility operator's commissioning procedures included functional test of PTs but did not include review of individual compressor component specifications. Subsequent communications between facility investigators and compressor representatives revealed that the compressor manufacturer did not intend to supply 17-4PH material in its compressor components; the diaphragm material was overlooked by the compressor manufacturer when sourcing the PT.
室外氢气压缩机上的压力传感器 (PT) 的传感隔膜意外破裂,从压缩机排气管中向大气释放了约 0.1 千克氢气。事故发生时,""啪 ""的一声巨响和粉尘扰动引起了附近人员的警觉。与此同时,设备监控系统检测到 PT 信号丢失,并启动了设备停机。设施人员随后关闭了隔离手阀以阻止泄漏,锁定并标记了设备,并限制了该区域。故障部件是一个雪茄型 PT,额定压力为 20,000 psi,最初由制造商提供和安装,是压缩机套件的一部分。检查发现电线断裂,电线外壳分离,电子元件丢失和电气灌封损坏。PT 位于受压力安全阀保护的管线上,压力安全阀设定为 15,400 psi。

设备调查人员后来发现,失效的放电 PT 是用 17-4PH 不锈钢隔膜制造的。这种不锈钢虽然是其他材料耐高压的工业标准,但在工业上却与氢气不相容。压缩机制造商提供的文件一般声称使用了在预期运行条件下可抵抗 H2 脆化影响的材料,但没有确定 PT 隔膜等内部组件的具体材料。设备运营商的试运行程序包括 PT 的功能测试,但不包括对各个压缩机部件规格的审查。设备调查员和压缩机代表之间的后续沟通显示,压缩机制造商并不打算在其压缩机部件中提供 17-4PH 材料；压缩机制造商在采购 PT 时忽略了隔膜材料。","None

Upon arrival, the incident commander noted that nothing out of the ordinary was visible on the exterior of the boat. A crew was sent to the interior of the boat to investigate. The boat was powered by diesel engines and there were no compressed gas cylinders on board.

After further investigation, it became apparent that the explosion had come from the battery compartment in the hull of the boat. The responders concluded that one of the batteries had been giving off hydrogen gas, which gradually built up inside the compartment. Since the compartment was not vented, the gas had nowhere to go. It found an ignition source (possibly a battery charger) and exploded.

The blast warped metal in the battery compartment, buckled some of the decking around the compartment, and shattered some windows (see photos). Luckily no one was on board during the explosion, so there were no injuries.

经过进一步调查,爆炸显然来自船体的电池舱。救援人员得出结论,其中一个电池一直在释放氢气,氢气在电池舱内逐渐积聚。由于电池舱没有通风口,气体无处可逃。它找到了一个火源（可能是电池充电器）并发生了爆炸。

爆炸使电池舱内的金属翘起,电池舱周围的一些甲板倒扣,一些窗户破碎（见照片）。幸运的是,爆炸时船上没有人,因此没有人员伤亡。","possibly a battery charger

The incorrectly sized gasket was mounted during the startup of the plant in 2001 and had never being inspected nor replaced.

Incident synopsis: The operating conditions were stable when the operator received an alarm indicating pressure loss in the circuit. He immediately instructed his field personnel to inspect the area. The hydrogen leak was confined inside the compressor room because the walls and roof were not provided with ventilation devices. An explosion occurred, causing two fatalities and the destruction of the compressor room and some of the surrounding area.

The process is completed by placing the material in lined tanks filled with hydrochloric acid (HCl). Approximately 500 pounds of corrugated stainless steel with platinum coating was inserted into a HCl leaching bath. Prior to starting the process, the supervisor tested the material for reactivity for a period of one hour, and the material showed very little reactivity. Operators began setting up three 500-gallon tanks, each containing the corrugated material. The material was covered with water and 4-5 inches of HCl was then added to the tank. When all three tanks were set up and there was only minimal reactivity observed (occasional bubbles), the operators left the area.

An employee walking through the parking lot noticed smoke coming from the leaching area and reported it to the security guards. The guards and the supervisor headed to the incident area. On arrival, they noticed a large amount of exposed metal above the surface of the bath. The metal was sparking and crackling (indicating catalytic activity) and hydrogen liberated from the reaction was flaring up from time to time as it was ignited by the sparks. There was no evidence of spilled liquid, which indicated that there was a leak from the tank liner.

The fire was extinguished with fire exchangers and water spray, but since the metal was still above the solution level, it flared up again minutes later. The supervisor and an operator added water to the incident tank while at the same time pumping the solution to an adjacent empty tank until the pH of the incident tank was approximately 1. The supervisor placed a fiberglass grating on top of the exposed metal to submerge it below the solution level.

Four photos are attached showing: 1) the material prior to processing, 2) the material ready for processing, 3) the process tank after the fire, and 4) the process tank after the fire with the fire-extinguishing media on top.
通过化学剥离和回收,从波纹不锈钢中回收废铂催化剂。将材料放入装有盐酸 (HCl) 的内衬槽中即可完成该过程。将大约 500 磅带有铂涂层的不锈钢波纹管放入盐酸浸出槽中。在工艺开始之前,主管人员对材料进行了一小时的反应性测试,结果显示材料的反应性非常低。操作员开始设置三个 500 加仑的槽,每个槽都装有波纹材料。将材料用水覆盖,然后向罐中加入 4-5 英寸的盐酸。当所有三个罐子都安装完毕且只观察到极少的反应性（偶尔出现气泡）时,操作员离开了该区域。

一名员工经过停车场时发现沥滤区冒烟,于是向保安报告。保安和主管前往事发区域。到达现场后,他们发现浴池表面有大量金属裸露在外。金属正在冒火花并发出噼啪声（表明存在催化活性）,反应释放出的氢气不时被火花点燃。没有任何液体溢出的迹象,这表明储罐内衬发生了泄漏。大火被灭火器和喷水扑灭,但由于金属仍在溶液水平面之上,几分钟后又再次燃烧起来。主管和一名操作员向事故槽中加水,同时将溶液泵入相邻的空槽中,直到事故槽的 pH 值约为 1。

运行期间","The ignition of the fireball could have been caused by any of the following mechanisms:	The inverse Joule-Thompson effect of hydrogen (i.e., heating upon expansion)	Some of the oil and light ends were above their auto-ignition temperatures	Contact with hot surfaces of the autoclave	Static electricity	Electrostatic discharge of the mixture.The possibility that the explosion may have been caused by the hydrogen discharged from the autoclave was thoroughly investigated. However, there were no signs of combustion in the upper part of the cell. Also, the explosion occurred approximately five minutes after the rupture disc release, long after the hydrogen source had been shut off and more than one air exchange had occurred in the cell.The following were identified as lessons learned from the incident:	The reactor outlet line was plugged with viscous oil, which resulted in over-pressurization of the system. If the plug had been in the feed line, the rupture disc on the reactor would never have been over-pressurized. If the staff had added a second rupture disc near the pump outlet to relieve pressure before the reactor rupture disc, with a check valve in between the two, the release might have been avoided. This design change was incorporated into the system rebuild.	The fixed-catalyst-bed tubular reactor system should have been reviewed and approved by health and safety, facilities engineering, or building management staff.	The inadequate hazard analysis of the installation resulted in failure to anticipate the need for containment or remote discharge of the rupture disc effluent. A thorough hazard analysis should have been done before operating the system.	The operators were not adequately trained on the hazards of the system. - Combustible materials and gas lecture bottles should not have been stored in the autoclave cell (i.e., poor housekeeping).	The fire failed to activate the sprinkler system because the exhaust fan was turned on within seconds of the rupture disc release, so the air change volume minimized the temperature rise within the cell.	The roof pressure vent panel failed to adequately relieve the explosion pressure.
火球的点燃可能是由以下任何一种机制引起的：氢气的逆焦耳-汤普森效应（即膨胀时发热）一些油和轻质油端超过了它们的自燃温度接触高压锅的热表面静电混合物的静电放电。对爆炸可能是由高压釜排出的氢气引起的这一可能性进行了彻底调查。但是,电池上部没有燃烧迹象。此外,爆炸发生在爆破片释放约 5 分钟后,而此时氢源早已关闭,且样品池内已进行了不止一次空气交换。从该事件中吸取的教训如下：反应器出口管线被粘性油堵塞,导致系统超压。如果堵塞物在进料管路中,反应器上的爆破片就不会超压。如果工作人员在泵出口附近增加了第二个爆破片,在反应器爆破片之前释放压力,并在两个爆破片之间加一个止回阀,就可能避免泄漏。这一设计变更已纳入系统重建中。固定催化剂床管式反应器系统应由健康与安全,设施工程或楼宇管理人员审查和批准。对安装的危险分析不足,导致未能预计到需要密封或远程排放爆破片流出物。在系统运行之前,本应进行彻底的危险分析。没有对操作人员进行有关该系统危险的充分培训。- 高压灭菌器单元内不应存放可燃材料和气体注射瓶（即内务管理不善）。火灾未能启动自动喷水灭火系统,因为排气扇是在爆破片释放后几秒钟内打开的,因此换气量最大限度地降低了灭火室的温升。屋顶压力通风板未能充分释放爆炸压力。","A fire occurred in a continuous-feed autoclave system (fixed-catalyst-bed tubular reactor) when the rupture disc released, discharging hot oil, oil distillates, and hydrogen gas out a vent pipe into the autoclave cell. The flammable mixture was discharged directly into the cell because there was no system in place to catch or remotely exhaust the autoclave contents. The oil and gas ignited in a fireball that, in turn, ignited nearby combustibles (cardboard and paper), causing a sustained fire. The hydrogen gas and autoclave system were shutoff immediately. However, a lecture bottle containing hydrogen sulfide was heated by the surrounding fire and ultimately ruptured with enough force to cause facility structural damage. (Lecture bottles do not have a pressure-relief device.) The explosion occurred about five minutes after the rupture disc released.

One employee received minor burns on his arm from the initial fireball. No other injuries occurred. Fire damage to the laboratory and equipment was minimal, but the cost of the structural damage caused by the explosion was estimated at about $55,000.
一个连续进料高压釜系统（固定催化剂床管式反应器）发生火灾,当时爆破片释放,热油,油馏分和氢气从通风管排入高压釜单元。易燃混合物直接排入反应室,因为没有任何系统可以捕捉或远程排出高压釜内的物质。油和气体被点燃形成火球,进而引燃了附近的可燃物（纸板和纸）,造成持续火灾。氢气和高压釜系统被立即关闭。然而,一个装有硫化氢的演讲瓶被周围的大火加热,最终破裂,其破裂力足以造成设施结构损坏。(演讲瓶没有降压装置）。爆炸发生在爆破片释放约五分钟后。

一名员工的手臂被最初的火球轻微烧伤。没有其他人员受伤。实验室和设备的火灾损失极小,但爆炸造成的结构性损失估计约为 55,000 美元。","unknown

Aluminum should have been separated from the refuse prior to feeding it to the incinerator, and this incident could have been avoided. Specific lessons learned included:	Incineration of crushed material with a high aluminum content was stopped.	Nitrogen should be used for purging combustible gas generated when blockage is removed.	Sufficient cooling time and safety confirmation steps must be completed prior to removing any blockage.	Water injection is no longer allowed. - An industrial camera and thermometer were installed for early detection of blockage.	The capacity of the ash pusher was increased.

A warning was issued to the public emphasizing the need for complete separation of combustibles and non-combustibles from their refuse.
调查确定,氢是由热铝和水反应形成的,空气从检查门进入,混合物被热熟料或凿子的火花点燃。在将垃圾送入焚化炉之前,本应将铝从垃圾中分离出来,这样就可以避免这起事故。具体经验教训包括：停止焚烧铝含量高的破碎材料。应使用氮气清除堵塞物时产生的可燃气体。在清除任何堵塞物之前,必须完成足够的冷却时间和安全确认步骤。不再允许注水。- 安装了工业照相机和温度计,以便及早发现堵塞。增加了推灰机的容量。为员工制定了标准操作程序。向公众发出警告,强调必须将可燃物和非可燃物与垃圾完全分开。","An explosion occurred in a 90-ton-per-day incinerator at a municipal refuse incineration facility. Three workers were seriously burned by high-temperature gas that spouted from the inspection door, and one of them died 10 days later. The accident happened during inspection and repair of the furnace ash chute damper. The workers injected water to remove some blockage, and the water reacted with incinerated aluminum ash to form hydrogen, which caused the explosion.

Workers noticed that the post-combustion zone was full of ash and the ash pusher was not working properly, so they tried to remove the ash from the inspection door with a shovel. They discovered a solid layer of ""clinker"", which is formed by solidification of molten material such as aluminum. The explosion occurred inside the ash chute while the operators were trying to crush the clinker with a chisel and intermittently injecting water.

运行期间","The investigation team concluded that hydrogen gas was released through a failed 19-inch diameter gasket and ignited under the roof of the compressor shed where it was partially confined. Some gas escaped from the shed prior to the explosion, but it was confined beneath the deck of an adjacent structure and overhead piping. The compressor shed was originally just a roof over the compressors, but over time, walls were added to aid winter operation and maintenance. These walls resulted in confinement of the hydrogen and contributed to the violent explosion.Unauthorized modifications played a major role in this incident. The team discovered that the original design specifications called for a spiral-wound gasket, but for the previous 7 or 8 years, only compressed asbestos fiber (CAF) gaskets had been used. It appears that the risk of the gasket disintegrating or blowing out during a high-pressure leak had not been identified.Actions taken as a result of the incident included the following:	Checklists for startup and shutdown procedures, and design and engineering safety were updated and became mandatory.	Pressure testing at operating pressure became mandatory prior to process startup.	Process hazard analysis was introduced. - Gasket material specifications were revised.	Separation standards were developed and implemented for all site buildings and facilities.	Shatter-resistant windows and doors were installed.	Process enclosures were minimized in new designs and existing enclosures were opened up and/or forced ventilation was upgraded.	A formal modification procedure was instituted (i.e., management of change).	Additional combustible gas detectors were installed, with frequent calibration and maintenance required. - Emergency shutoff valves were installed on vessels with critical hydrocarbon inventories.	Awareness of chemical processing hazards was increased among all employees through better communication and training.
调查组的结论是,氢气通过一个直径 19 英寸的失效垫圈释放出来,并在压缩机棚顶下被点燃,氢气在那里被部分封闭。在爆炸发生之前,有一些气体从压缩机棚中泄漏,但这些气体被限制在相邻结构的甲板和架空管道下面。压缩机棚最初只是压缩机上的一个顶棚,但随着时间的推移,为了便于冬季运行和维护,又加盖了墙壁。这些墙壁导致氢气被封闭,并引发了剧烈爆炸。未经授权的改装在这次事故中起了重要作用。小组发现,最初的设计规范要求使用螺旋缠绕垫圈,但在过去的 7,8 年中,一直只使用压缩石棉纤维 (CAF) 垫片。看来,垫片在高压泄漏时解体或炸裂的风险尚未被发现。事故发生后采取的措施包括：更新并强制执行启动和关闭程序以及设计和工程安全的核对表。在工艺启动之前,必须在工作压力下进行压力测试。引入了工艺危害分析。- 修订了垫片材料规格。为所有现场建筑和设施制定并实施了隔离标准。安装了防碎门窗。在新的设计中尽量减少工艺围墙,打开现有围墙和/或更新强制通风系统。制定了正式的修改程序（即变更管理）。安装了更多的可燃气体探测器,并需要经常校准和维护。- 在有重要碳氢化合物库存的容器上安装了紧急切断阀。通过加强沟通和培训,提高了所有员工对化学加工危险的认识。","A hydrogen explosion and fire occurred in the benzene unit of a styrene plant in a large petrochemical complex. The unit was being restarted following a scheduled maintenance shutdown. The explosion followed the release of about 30 kilograms of 700-psig hydrogen gas from a burst flange into a compressor shed. Two men were killed and two others were injured. If it had not been a holiday, the death toll and injuries would probably have been much worse.

The operators were bringing the plant online and increasing the hydrogen circulation pressure. About 10-15 seconds before the explosion, they heard a pop and then a loud hiss of pressure being released within the compressor shed. Witnesses reported seeing a white flash and then a large fireball. The fires burned out in 2-3 minutes, except for benzene leaking from a ruptured flange that continued to burn for 8 hours because there was no emergency shutoff valve to isolate the vessel.

The metal roof and heavy metal door of the compressor shed were blown several hundred feet away. Piping, ladders, and other steel equipment were severely deformed by the blast. Ceilings fell and instruments were damaged in the control house, about 75 feet away from the compressor shed. Office buildings about 1200 feet away sustained damages to windows, doors, and masonry.
一家大型石化联合企业苯乙烯工厂的苯装置发生氢气爆炸和火灾。该装置在按计划停机检修后重新启动。爆炸发生后,约 30 千克 700 psig 的氢气从爆裂的法兰释放到压缩机棚内。两人死亡,两人受伤。如果不是节假日,伤亡情况可能会更糟。

当时,操作人员正在将工厂联机,并增加氢气循环压力。在爆炸前约 10-15 秒,他们听到一声爆响,然后是压缩机棚内压力释放的巨大嘶嘶声。目击者称看到一道白色闪光,然后是一个大火球。大火在 2-3 分钟内烧尽,但由于没有紧急切断阀隔离容器,从破裂的法兰中泄漏的苯继续燃烧了 8 个小时。

压缩机棚的金属屋顶和厚重的金属门被吹出几百英尺远。管道,梯子和其他钢制设备在爆炸中严重变形。距离压缩机房约 75 英尺的控制室天花板掉落,仪器受损。距离约 1200 英尺的办公楼的窗户,门和砖石也遭到破坏。","unknown

The Auxiliary Operator (AO) performed a pre-job brief with shift management before adding hydrogen to the main generator. While performing the addition, the AO attempted to verify open a half-inch hydrogen addition valve. The AO was unable to move the valve by hand and mistakenly assumed the valve was stuck on its closed seat. The valve is a normally open valve and the procedure step was to verify the valve was, in fact, open. The AO obtained a pipe wrench to assist in freeing the valve off of its ""closed"" seat. Using the pipe wrench, the valve handwheel was turned in the open direction. The AO attempted to open the valve by hand again. Unable to move the valve by hand, the pipe wrench was used to further open the valve approximately 6 turns (two turns of the handwheel for this particular valve results in full stem travel). The bonnet, handwheel, stem and valve internals were eventually ejected from the body of the valve by hydrogen system pressure. The AO promptly evacuated the area due to the hydrogen release and the hydrogen ignited within seconds. The AO informed the Control Room via radio of the leak and fire at the hydrogen add station. The AO and other operators proceeded immediately to the hydrogen bulk storage facility to isolate the hydrogen supply to the turbine building.

The control room supervisor directed a manual reactor trip. The plant Fire Plan and Abnormal Operating Procedure were entered and the fire brigade was dispatched. The hydrogen fire was extinguished following isolation of the hydrogen supply. However, there continued to be re-flash, arcing, and a small fire in the cable tray located in the overhead above the hydrogen add station. Fire extinguishers and eventually water were used to extinguish the fire in the cables.

A Notification of Unusual Event was declared for a fire not extinguished within 10 minutes. No injuries occurred as a result of this event. The damage in the cable tray required the replacement of 29 cables (480 volt). This and other damage to local components required the Unit to be shutdown for approximately five days to complete repairs.
1 号机组启动后,电厂功率稳定在 90%。在向主发电机添加氢气之前,辅助操作员 (AO) 与当班管理人员进行了工作前简报。在加氢过程中,辅助操作员试图打开一个半英寸的加氢阀。AO 无法用手移动阀门,误以为阀门被卡在关闭的阀座上。该阀门是一个常开阀门,程序步骤是验证阀门是否打开。AO 获得了一把管钳,以帮助将阀门从其 ""关闭 ""的阀座上释放出来。使用管钳将阀门手轮转到打开方向。AO 再次尝试用手打开阀门。在无法用手移动阀门的情况下,使用管钳将阀门进一步打开约 6 圈（该阀门的手轮转动两圈即可使阀杆全开）。在氢气系统压力的作用下,阀盖,手轮,阀杆和阀门内件最终从阀体中弹出。由于氢气释放,AO 迅速撤离了该区域,氢气在几秒钟内被点燃。操作员通过无线电向控制室通报了氢气添加站发生泄漏和火灾的情况。AO 和其他操作员立即前往氢气散装储存设施,以隔离涡轮机大楼的氢气供应。控制室主管指示进行手动反应堆跳闸。输入了电厂消防计划和异常运行程序,并派出了消防队。在隔离氢气供应后,氢火被扑灭。然而,在氢气添加站上方的架空电缆桥架上,继续出现重闪,电弧和小火。使用灭火器并最终用水扑灭了电缆中的火。

10 分钟内未扑灭的火灾被宣布为异常事件。此次事件未造成人员伤亡。由于电缆盘受损,需要更换 29 条电缆（480 伏）。由于电缆盘的损坏,需要更换 29 条电缆（480 伏）。由于电缆盘的损坏和其他本地组件的损坏,机组需要停机约五天来完成维修。","self ignition

The gas supply tubing was too long for its intended purpose and posed a hazard in its coiled state near the outlet. This near miss had the potential for more significant damage/impact to the facility and to the researcher because of a hydrogen gas supply line also in close proximity to the same outlet.Laboratories should be inspected to ensure that gas supply lines are protected against electrical exposure in the following manner:	Limit the amount of copper tubing to the length that is necessary to reach the intended equipment.	Secure gas supply lines to the wall and/or counter top in a way that will prevent electrical exposure.	Perform visual inspections for loose lines before removing electrical plugs from outlets.	Ensure that there are no exposed energized parts of electrical circuits or equipment near your compressed gas systems.

检查期间","The direct cause of the over-pressurization of the two drums was the repackaging of the phosphoric acid into metal UN1A1 drums and the resultant hydrogen gas generation within the sealed drums. At the time of this incident (1997), 49 CFR and several MSDSs supported the selection of the UN1A1 drums. After the incident, laboratory studies conducted by facility staff indicated that the corrosion and subsequent hydrogen gas generation rates for the amount of phosphoric acid present would result in a pressure buildup and the drum failures observed. Facility staff then contacted DOT to request that changes be made to the packaging guidance listed for this material.
造成这两个桶超压的直接原因是将磷酸重新包装到 UN1A1 金属桶中,以及由此在密封桶内产生的氢气。事故发生时（1997 年）,《美国联邦法规第 49 条》和几份材料安全数据表都支持选用 UN1A1 包装桶。事件发生后,工厂员工进行的实验室研究表明,就磷酸的含量而言,腐蚀和随后的氢气产生率会导致压力升高,并导致观察到的桶故障。工厂员工随后联系了 DOT,要求修改该材料的包装指南。","An over-pressurization of two 55-gallon drums of waste phosphoric acid resulted in a material failure of the drum bottoms, releasing the contents of both drums (about 100 gallons) onto the facility floor. The spillage was collected within the sumps that are part of the facility's spill control system. The waste material had been packaged into DOT-specified containers earlier that day and the drums were placed into an assigned storage cell. That evening a staff member heard a noise in the high bay where hazardous wastes are stored. Upon investigating, he discovered the breached drums and spilled material.

The only material released to the environment was hydrogen gas. The maximum concentration of hydrogen released into the facility was 0.035%, well below the lower flammability limit of 4%. The spilled material was absorbed with vermiculite and repackaged. Samples were taken of the spilled acid to be processed to assist in the determination of the cause of the drum ruptures.

All buildings near areas where hydrogen is used should be designed to preclude GH2 entrapment (e.g., sloping roof with ventilation at the highest point).	Underground carbon steel lines beneath concrete pad areas should not be used for GH2 transmission. All GH2 lines are now stainless steel and above ground. - Any GH2 transmission lines buried underground should be proof-tested and leak-checked on a periodic basis.	Any below-grade piping installation should be in open trenches covered by grating.	Facilities should be protected from GH2, at a safe distance, by manual isolation valves. If remote-operated valves (ROVs) are required for operational isolation purposes, the ROVs should be in series with and downstream of the manual isolation valve.	The pressure between isolation valves and stand shut-off valves should be routinely monitored on a daily basis.	Field repair of mechanically severable valves in high-pressure systems should be eliminated.	Valves repaired in the field should be subjected to functional and leak checks, including actuator and valve seals at simulated operating conditions. A written procedure should be prepared and used.	Valves utilizing pneumatic actuators should have actuator piston and piston nut staked (or locked by other positive means) in the installed condition.	All high-pressure gas lines scheduled to be inactive for periods greater than 6 months should be physically isolated by blind flanges from active systems.	Supply system status of pressure vessels and lines (pressure and/or quantity) should be recorded at the start and completion of operations each day. All reservoirs should be isolated at close of business each day, and before weekends and holidays.	Corrosion protection systems for underground lines should be reviewed and tested to confirm the adequacy of the systems.	Operational and support buildings at hazardous sites should be isolated (i.e., interconnecting air conditioning systems should be avoided). Buildings connected to hazardous sites by tunnels and/or conduits should be physically isolated by seals. If physical isolation is not practical, then positive air flow should be maintained in tunnels and conduits.	Explosive gas detection meters should be included in the equipment carried by firefighters and emergency medical personnel.	Fire alarm transmitters should be located at all hazardous locations.	Emergency instructions for isolating GH2 and utilities for hazardous locations should be permanently posted with names and telephone numbers of key individuals to be contacted.
应在所有靠近 GH2 源的封闭建筑物内安装有源 GH2 传感器,并对其进行持续监测。使用氢气区域附近的所有建筑物在设计上都应防止 GH2 吸入（例如,在最高点通风的倾斜屋顶）。混凝土垫层下的地下碳钢管线不得用于传输 GH2。目前,所有 GH2 线路均为不锈钢地面线路。- 任何埋在地下的 GH2 输电线路都应定期进行验证测试和泄漏检查。任何地面以下的管道安装都应在露天沟槽中进行,并用格栅覆盖。应通过手动隔离阀保护设施与 GH2 保持安全距离。如果出于操作隔离目的需要使用遥控阀 (ROV),则遥控阀应与手动隔离阀串联,并位于手动隔离阀的下游。应每天对隔离阀和支架截止阀之间的压力进行例行监测。应杜绝在现场维修高压系统中可机械切断的阀门。现场维修的阀门应进行功能和泄漏检查,包括在模拟运行条件下检查执行机构和阀门密封件。应编制并使用书面程序。使用气动执行机构的阀门应在安装状态下将执行机构活塞和活塞螺母固定（或用其他有效方法锁定）。所有计划停用时间超过 6 个月的高压气体管道都应使用盲板法兰与使用中的系统进行物理隔离。压力容器和管线的供应系统状态（压力和/或数量）应在每天操作开始和结束时进行记录。应在每天营业结束时,周末和节假日前隔离所有蓄水池。应对地下管线的防腐蚀系统进行审查和测试,以确认系统的适当性。应隔离危险场所的操作楼和辅助楼（即应避免空调系统相互连接）。通过隧道和/或管道与危险场所相连的建筑物应使用密封件进行物理隔离。如果物理隔离不可行,则应在隧道和管道中保持正气流。消防员和紧急医疗人员携带的设备中应包括爆炸性气体检测仪。火灾报警发射器应安装在所有危险场所。隔离 GH2 和危险场所公用设施的紧急指示应永久张贴,并注明需要联系的关键人员的姓名和电话号码。","Only 25 minutes after the normal work shift ended, an explosion occurred at a hydrogen storage and use facility that had been in a non-operational mode for several months while undergoing modifications for future tests. No one was in the facility at the time of the explosion. The event was viewed about 30 seconds after the explosion by two engineers in a blockhouse 1000 feet away. Authorities were notified and calls were placed to other personnel needed to secure the area. About 8 minutes later, the engineers moved to a vantage point about 450 feet from the facility. There they viewed heat waves rising from a central location on the test pad, heard popping sounds similar to gaseous hydrogen (GH2) venting on a burn pond, and suspected that a hydrogen fire was in process. They returned to the blockhouse and then traveled via a safe route to where the hydrogen storage vessels were located. Two large manual supply valves were closed, isolating the GH2 source about 30 minutes after the explosion. The facility's other supply systems and utilities had been severed or ruptured. Shrapnel and debris were ejected up to 540 feet away. Teams of firefighters and emergency medical personnel were sent to the area to verify that no one was injured and to extinguish small residual fires.

Damage was significant, including destruction of two support buildings, one 27 x 33 ft, the other 28 x 48 ft. One building, a single-story structure with a basement, served as an electrical control and instrumentation terminal. It was constructed of 14-inch-thick reinforced-concrete walls designed to withstand an external explosion of 4500 lbs of TNT 600 feet away. The second building was a shop and support building constructed of 8-inch-thick concrete blocks, filled with concrete and reinforced with steel rods. The support building was located about 90 feet from the terminal building and the two were interconnected by underground air conditioning and electrical ducts. Other structures and support systems in the vicinity were also extensively damaged. Costs incurred from the explosion were estimated to be approximately $5.9 million. Detectable levels of GH2 were recorded at several locations adjacent to the concrete pad for a five-day period following the event.

Findings of the investigation board were as follows:
	- The explosion was the result of a massive GH2 leak.
	- A GH2 leak occurred in an underground ASTM A106 Grade B, Schedule XX carbon steel pipe with a 3.5-inch diameter and a 0.6-inch wall thickness. The pipe was coated with coal tar primer and coal tar enamel, wrapped with asbestos felt impregnated with coal tar, coated with a second coat of coal tar enamel, and wrapped in Kraft paper, in accordance with American Water Works Association Standard G203. The source of the leak was an oval hole about 0.15 in x 0.20 in in at the inner surface of the pipe and about 2 in in diameter at the outer surface of the pipe. Upon excavation of the pipe, it was noted that the coating was not present at the leak point. This resulted in galvanic corrosion over a 15-year period and the eventual rupture when high-pressure gas was applied to the thin pipe membrane. The pipe was 8 ft 9 in below the concrete pad.
	- Prior to the pipe rupture, a pneumatically operated GH2 isolation gate valve, designed for 6000 psi service and located about 280 feet from the facility, failed in the open position. Pneumatic pressure had been removed earlier in the day and failure analysis indicated that the valve had been damaged during recent field servicing. Leakage across the main seals of the valve over time, due to operations at another facility, permitted a pressure buildup within and downstream of the valve, sufficient to drive the valve to the open position. The failure was duplicated during failure analysis testing. This failure allowed GH2 in excess of 4000 psi to enter the 3-inch GH2 line buried beneath the concrete apron surface next to the facility.
	- GH2 was trapped in large quantities in sand and gravel under the apron surface (a 1-foot-thick concrete pad about 160 x 140 ft). GH2 then entered the basement of the electrical control and instrumentation terminal building, located immediately adjacent to the facility, through penetrations in the basement wall, including cable ducts, cable pulls, and two 24-inch-diameter air conditioning ducts. GH2 was transported through the air conditioning ducts to a support building about 90 feet from the terminal building.
	- An explosion originated in the basement of the terminal building. A shock wave traveled through the air conditioning ducts and caused a second explosion of lesser magnitude in the support building. The actual ignition source in the terminal building is unknown, however an electrical arc from a sump pump was considered to be the most likely source.
	- The TNT equivalent of the blast was calculated to be between 100 and 475 pounds, depending on the location.
正常工作班次结束后仅 25 分钟,一个氢气储存和使用设施发生了爆炸,该设施在为未来测试进行改装期间已数月处于非运行状态。爆炸发生时,设施内无人。爆炸发生约 30 秒后,在 1000 英尺外的一个碉堡中的两名工程师看到了这一事件。他们通知了有关当局,并呼叫其他人员保护该区域安全。大约 8 分钟后,工程师们转移到距离设施约 450 英尺的有利位置。在那里,他们看到热浪从试验台的中心位置升起,听到类似于燃烧池上气态氢（GH2）排出的爆裂声,并怀疑正在发生氢火灾。他们返回碉堡,然后通过安全路线前往氢气储存容器所在位置。爆炸发生约 30 分钟后,两个大型手动供应阀被关闭,隔离了 GH2 源。该设施的其他供应系统和公用设施已被切断或破裂。弹片和碎片被抛射到 540 英尺之外。消防员和紧急医疗人员小组被派往该地区,核实无人受伤,并扑灭了残留的小火。其中一栋建筑是带地下室的单层结构,用作电气控制和仪器终端。它由 14 英寸厚的钢筋混凝土墙壁建成,可抵御 600 英尺外 4500 磅 TNT 的外部爆炸。第二座建筑是车间和辅助建筑,由 8 英寸厚的混凝土块建成,内填混凝土并用钢筋加固。辅助楼距离航站楼约 90 英尺,两者之间通过地下空调和电气管道相连。附近的其他结构和支持系统也遭到了严重破坏。爆炸造成的损失估计约为 590 万美元。在事件发生后的五天内,在混凝土垫附近的几个地点记录到了可检测到的 GH2 水平。

调查委员会的调查结果如下：
- 爆炸是 GH2 大量泄漏造成的。
- GH2 泄漏发生在直径 3.5 英寸,壁厚 0.6 英寸的地下 ASTM A106 B 级 XX 碳钢管中。按照美国水工程协会标准 G203,管道上涂有煤焦油底漆和煤焦油瓷漆,并用浸过煤焦油的石棉毡包裹,再涂上第二层煤焦油瓷漆,然后用牛皮纸包裹。泄漏源是管道内表面的一个椭圆形孔,直径约为 0.15 英寸 x 0.20 英寸,管道外表面直径约为 2 英寸。挖掘管道时发现,泄漏点没有涂层。这导致了 15 年的电化学腐蚀,当高压气体作用在薄薄的管道膜上时,管道最终破裂。管道位于混凝土垫下 8 英尺 9 英寸处。
- 在管道破裂之前,一个气动 GH2 隔离闸阀在打开位置发生故障,该阀门设计用于 6000 psi 的服务,距离设施约 280 英尺。气动压力在当天早些时候已被卸除,故障分析表明,该阀门在最近的现场维修过程中已损坏。由于另一设施的运行,阀门的主密封件长期泄漏,导致阀门内部和下游的压力积聚,足以将阀门推至打开位置。在故障分析测试过程中,该故障再次发生。这一故障使得超过 4000 psi 的 GH2 进入埋在设施旁混凝土停机坪表面下的 3 英寸 GH2 管线。
- GH2 大量滞留在停机坪表面（1 英尺厚的混凝土垫,约 160 x 140 英尺）下的沙石中。然后,GH2 通过地下室墙壁上的穿透物,包括电缆管道,电缆拉线和两个直径 24 英寸的空调管道,进入紧邻该设施的电气控制和仪器仪表终端大楼的地下室。GH2 通过空调管道被输送到距离航站楼约 90 英尺的支撑楼。
- 爆炸源于航站楼的地下室。冲击波穿过空调管道,在辅助楼中引发了第二次爆炸,但爆炸程度较小。航站楼内的实际点火源尚不明了,但据认为最有可能的点火源是抽水泵产生的电弧。
- 根据计算,爆炸的 TNT 当量在 100 至 475 磅之间,具体取决于爆炸地点。","an electrical arc from a sump pump

There are few scenarios that do not involve enclosed spaces (e.g., a car) and the potential for static discharge. Perhaps a mesh bag would work, as long as sufficient ventilation is ensured. Nonetheless, using lecture bottles and filling balloons on-site seems to be the safest method. Yet if the floor in the demonstration area were carpeted, enough static could be generated to ignite a balloon. The demonstrator's greatest fear is that a child might ask to participate in the demonstration, then reach out to touch the balloon and have it detonate in their face.The demonstrator feels fortunate that his injuries were relatively minor (no respiratory damage). He urges that a full risk assessment be performed prior to balloon storage/transportation and setup/performance of this type of science demonstration. Guidance for undertaking a hazard analysis and risk assessment can be found in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
安全储存和运输装有氢氧混合物的气球是一项非常危险的工作。很少有不涉及封闭空间（如汽车）和静电放电可能性的情况。只要保证足够的通风,也许网袋也可以使用。不过,使用演讲瓶和现场填充气球似乎是最安全的方法。然而,如果演示区的地板上铺有地毯,产生的静电足以点燃气球。演示者最担心的是,一个孩子可能会要求参加演示,然后伸手去触摸气球,结果气球在他们的脸上爆炸了。该演示者感到幸运的是,他的伤势相对较轻（没有呼吸系统损伤）。他敦促在气球储存/运输和设置/执行此类科学演示之前进行全面的风险评估。有关进行危害分析和风险评估的指导,请参阅《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","An accident occurred during setup for a popular hydrogen-oxygen balloon science demonstration at a local public school. The demonstrator suffered painful second-degree burns to his right forearm and was taken to the hospital. The paramedics feared that grave respiratory damage (due to flame inhalation) might have occurred.

The demonstrator had transported 15 helium-quality balloons, pre-filled with a hydrogen-oxygen mixture, in a large, black, polyethylene garbage bag. During the setup, he opened the bag to remove a single balloon for stringing and floating. Without warning, the entire bag of balloons detonated violently. Fortunately, the incident occurred an hour prior to the program and no one else was near. It was also fortunate that only a small box caught fire and none of the other chemicals, already in place for other demonstrations, were involved.

Slow leakage of hydrogen from the balloons (since no balloon is capable of completely containing hydrogen) resulted in accumulation of hydrogen and oxygen inside the garbage bag. The dry, sealed bag created an environment ripe for the generation of static electricity. Simply touching the balloons ignited the leaking hydrogen and all 15 balloons.
在当地一所公立学校举行的氢氧气球科普演示活动的准备过程中发生了一起事故。演示者的右前臂二度烧伤,疼痛难忍,被送往医院。医护人员担心可能会造成严重的呼吸系统损伤（由于吸入火焰）。

该示威者用一个黑色聚乙烯大垃圾袋装运了 15 个预充了氢氧混合物的氦气球。在设置过程中,他打开袋子,取出一个气球进行串联和漂浮。在毫无征兆的情况下,整袋气球被猛烈引爆。幸运的是,事件发生在节目开始前一小时,附近没有其他人。同样幸运的是,只有一个小盒子着火,其他已经用于其他演示的化学品都没有被卷入。

氢气从气球中缓慢泄漏（因为没有一个气球能够完全容纳氢气）,导致氢气和氧气在垃圾袋内积聚。干燥,密封的垃圾袋为静电的产生创造了一个成熟的环境。只要碰一下气球,就会点燃泄漏的氢气和所有 15 个气球。","None

虽然运输前的准备程序与以前的外联项目相同,但这次的情况有所不同。不清楚是什么原因点燃了第一个气球,然后引发了其他气球的连锁反应。这次事件表明,运输准备工作是整个过程中非常重要的一环,应与整个过程中的其他因素一起对风险因素进行评估。","During the early morning hours on a Tuesday, a university support staff member was preparing for an off-campus community outreach program for high-school-age students in the community. One of the program demonstrations was to show students the reaction energy and properties of the hydrogen + oxygen = water chemical reaction. It was a demonstration that the professor and the staff member overseeing the program had done for over 15 years with no incidents ever occurring.

To prepare for the demonstration, eight balloons were filled, four with pure hydrogen and four with the proper combination of hydrogen and oxygen. The balloons were placed into a larger plastic garbage bag and carried outside to a university-owned SUV located next to the building's loading dock. The bag of balloons was being placed into the vehicle from the right side door. The balloons were inside the vehicle, but not yet in their final place for transport. As the staff member was leaning into the doorway during this placement, a balloon at the top end of the bag ignited, which then set off a fiery explosive reaction involving the other balloons.

The staff member, who received burns to the face, was transported to a nearby hospital by the professor. The vehicle's windshield and two back windows were damaged, and the headliner of the vehicle was slightly scorched.

The defined activities should address requirements for rendering inert, isolation (i.e., physical disconnect, double block and bleed, etc.) and periodic monitoring.	The using organization should develop a process to periodically monitor hazardous systems for proper configuration (i.e., a daily/weekly/monthly check sheet to verify critical purges are active).
建议：使用机构应确定必要的活动,以便使氢气系统处于长期闲置状态。所定义的活动应满足惰性化,隔离（即物理断开,双重阻断和放气等）和定期监控的要求。使用组织应制定一个流程,定期监控危险系统的正确配置（即,每日/每周/每月的检查表,以核实关键清洗是否有效）。","In the fall of 2007, the operations team began a procedure (a written procedure was being followed) to sample the liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage vessels (""tanks""), and associated transfer system. This procedure was being performed to determine the conditions within the system, and if necessary, to purge the system of any excess gaseous hydrogen (GH2) in preparation for reactivation of the system. The system had not been used since 2003.

The LH2 storage system contains two (2) spherical pressure vessels of 225,000 gallons in volume, with a maximum working pressure (MAWP) of 50 psig. Eight-inch transfer piping connects them to the usage point. Operations began with activation of the burnstack for the LH2 storage area. Pneumatic gaseous nitrogen (GN2) systems in the storage area were then activated and checked.

Pressurization of storage tank number 1 with GN2 was initiated, with a target pressure of 10 psig, at which point samples were planned to be taken. At 5 psig, a loud noise was heard in the upper area of tank number 2. Smoke was seen exiting the burnstack and from the insulation on vent lines for both tanks. At this time, tank number 1 was vented and the pressurization system was secured.

The mishap resulted in physical damage to both storage tanks, as well as to some of the piping for both tanks. External to the storage tanks, there was extensive damage to three bellows on a pressurization line, vent line, and instrumentation port due to excessive axial movement. There was also evidence of heat buildup in both vent lines. Significant charring was noted on the tank number 2 external vent line insulation. Internally, extensive damage to the number 2 storage tank was noted. The internal bellows on the manway was distorted and ruptured. The pressurization ring was found lying in the bottom of the tank, where it had fallen after becoming dislodged from its holding brackets. The internal tank personnel ladder was also dislodged and lying against the side of the tank. The three anti-vortex baffles were displaced and the screens were destroyed. There was damage to the inactive level sensor system, including cable damage. Tank wall discoloration as well as aluminum and metal slag found in the bottom of the tank and charring of the external vent line insulation indicated a high-temperature mishap.

The LH2 tanks and vent system were not properly maintained after the last use in 2003. This allowed hydrogen to remain in the system, providing a fuel source. A fault tree process was used to determine that air entered the system via two possible mechanisms: 1) the vent line was disconnected at several places for installation of new bellows, allowing air to enter the vent line system; and 2) the purge panel was deactivated allowing air to enter the system via the burnstack. During the operation, the hydrogen/air mixture reached a level sufficient to allow combustion, and the flame from the burnstack provided the ignition source. The result was a fire/deflagration that traveled back through the vent line and into the LH2 tanks, causing further fire/deflagration/detonation.

The most probable cause of ignition was determined to be the burnstack pilots, which were active during the mishap. It was determined that a combustible hydrogen/air mixture most likely reached the burnstack exit and served as a ""wick"" to ignite the remainder of the system. Check valves and the vent valve in the system could not to arrest a hydrogen flame as it traveled in the vent system towards the tanks.

Corrective action included repair of the damaged hardware by a qualified contractor. Preventive action included documented organizational policy and procedures for establishing standby and mothball conditions for facilities and equipment, including provisions as detailed in the investigation report recommendations:
2007 年秋季,运营小组开始对液态氢（LH2）储存容器（""储罐""）和相关传输 系统进行采样（正在遵循书面程序）。执行这一程序是为了确定系统内的状况,并在必要时清除系统内多余的气态氢（GH2）,为重新启动系统做好准备。该系统自 2003 年以来一直未使用过。

LH2 储存系统包含两 (2) 个球形压力容器,容积为 225,000 加仑,最大工作压力 (MAWP) 为 50 psig。八英寸传输管道将它们连接到使用点。操作从启动 LH2 储存区的燃烧炉开始。随后启动并检查了储存区的气态氮气 (GN2) 系统。

开始用 GN2 给 1 号储罐加压,目标压力为 10 psig,计划在此时取样。在 5 psig 的压力下,2 号储罐上部区域传出了巨大的噪音。可以看到烟雾从燃烧炉和两个储罐通风管道的隔热层中排出。此时,1 号储油罐已排空,加压系统也已关闭。

这次事故对两个储油罐以及两个储油罐的部分管道造成了物理损坏。在储油罐外部,由于轴向移动过大,加压管线,通风管线和仪表端口上的三个波纹管受到严重损坏。两条通风管道也有热量积聚的迹象。2 号油罐外部通气管绝缘层严重烧焦。从内部来看,2 号储油罐受到了严重损坏。人行道上的内部波纹管扭曲破裂。增压环从固定支架上脱落后掉落在储罐底部。罐体内部的人员爬梯也已脱落,躺在罐体一侧。三个防涡挡板移位,滤网被毁。非活动液位传感器系统受损,包括电缆受损。罐壁变色,罐底发现铝和金属熔渣,外部通风管绝缘烧焦,表明发生了高温事故。

LH2 罐和通风系统在 2003 年最后一次使用后没有得到适当维护。这使得氢气残留在系统中,提供了一个燃料源。利用故障树程序确定空气通过两种可能的机制进入系统：1）通风管道在安装新波纹管时有多处断开,导致空气进入通风管道系统；2）清洗板失效,导致空气通过燃烧炉进入系统。在操作过程中,氢气/空气混合物达到了足以进行燃烧的水平,燃烧炉的火焰提供了点火源。结果导致起火/爆燃,并通过通风管道返回到 LH2 罐,造成进一步的起火/爆燃/引爆。

最有可能的点火原因被确定为在事故期间处于工作状态的燃烧堆引燃器。据确定,可燃氢气/空气混合物很可能到达燃烧室出口,并成为点燃系统其余部分的 ""灯芯""。系统中的止回阀和排气阀无法阻止氢火焰在排气系统中向储气罐蔓延。

纠正措施包括由合格的承包商修理损坏的硬件。预防行动包括以文件形式记录为设施和设备建立备用和停用条件的组织政策和程 序,其中包括调查报告建议中详述的规定：。","burnstack

Four persons were taken to the hospital for injuries. Three of these were treated and released shortly thereafter; the fourth was kept overnight and released the following evening. All of the exterior windows in the laboratory were blown out and there was significant damage within the laboratory. One sprinkler was activated that controlled a fire associated with a compressed hydrogen gas cylinder.

First responders from the local community and the university campus were quickly on the scene. Once the injured were attended to and the site secured, response efforts focused first on assessing potential hazards (electrical, fire, hazardous materials, etc). Campus personnel worked into the night to board up windows, isolate utility services, clean up debris, and otherwise secure the affected laboratories. The building reopened to occupants the following morning. There was minor water damage from sprinkler water in the laboratory below the explosion, but no equipment was damaged.

The laboratory works with soil bacteria that cannot survive in the presence of oxygen. As a result, research work is conducted inside a plastic chamber in which the chemical constituents in the air can be controlled. The explosion occurred during the set up of one of these chambers. The chamber is essentially a plastic bag with a volume of approximately two cubic meters. The setup procedure calls for using nitrogen to purge normal atmospheric air out of the bag three times, leaving a very small amount of residual oxygen present. The remaining small amount of oxygen is then removed by reaction with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst to form water.

Hydrogen was mistakenly introduced into the plastic bag as part of the first purge. As a result, the hydrogen concentration reached an explosive level inside the bag due to the relatively large presence of oxygen. The ignition source was most likely an electrical source inside the chamber or the palladium catalyst becoming too hot. The burn pattern observed after the explosion suggests that the fire ignited at the position of the catalyst, but that doesn't rule out the possibility that a spark was involved. The amount of hydrogen involved could not have exceeded one pound, which is the capacity of the compressed gas cylinder when full.

The investigation uncovered several procedural and design items that contributed to the explosion occurring:

	One of the first steps of the procedure is to ensure that the lines leading from the nitrogen and hydrogen compressed gas cylinders are tight and do not contain any leaks. This was done by opening the tanks to pressurize the lines, but leaving the end valve in the ""off"" position. One then applies soapy water to each connection to see if there are any bubbles that would indicate a leak. When this check was completed, the research technicians forgot to turn the hydrogen tank back off prior to beginning the three purges with nitrogen.
	Both compressed gas cylinders were connected to the chamber through a common tube through a ""T"" connector. A valve on the end had to be held open manually to introduce gas into the plastic bag. Normally, there would be a toggle switch inside the ""T"" connection that would be used to allow nitrogen or hydrogen, but not both, to be introduced into the chamber. At some point in the past, the right parts were unavailable, so that the ""T"" connection in use at the time of the explosion did not have a toggle switch. Had the toggle switch been present, the explosion would have been unlikely to have occurred.
	One does not need to use pure hydrogen to scavenge for oxygen. One alternative to pure hydrogen would be to purchase a mixture of 95% nitrogen and 5% hydrogen. Since the lower explosive concentration of hydrogen in air is about 4%, the alternative mixture would be less likely to create an explosive atmosphere even if the gas were mistakenly introduced into the chamber prematurely.
	The laboratory had previously tried to use hydrogen and oxygen sensors as a precaution to warn of an explosive atmosphere in the chamber. However, the atmosphere proved to be corrosive, which led to an inaccurate sensor readout that resulted in a dangerous gas mixture in the chamber. Had sensors been available while the chamber was brought online, again it is unlikely the explosion would have occurred.

There were a number of factors that mitigated the damage and allowed normal building activities to resume relatively quickly:

	The laboratory group practiced good housekeeping, which minimized secondary impacts from the explosion.
	Emergency information about hazards in the laboratory was posted outside the door and was helpful to emergency responders.
	The Emergency Action Plan for the building had identified exit routes and a plan for evacuating the building in the event of an emergency. Building occupants followed the plan in a timely manner.
	During the recent remodeling of the building, utilities were reconfigured for the laboratories such that each laboratory could be isolated. This reconfiguration of utilities allowed service to the affected laboratories to be cut off while service to the remaining laboratories in the building continued to function.
	Cooperation between local first responders and campus personnel was excellent. This cooperative approach was built on a history of exercises and coordination meetings to strengthen working relationships.
一所大学的生物化学实验室发生氢气爆炸。四人受伤被送往医院。其中三人接受治疗后不久出院；第四人留院过夜,次日傍晚出院。实验室的所有外窗都被炸毁,实验室内部也遭到严重破坏。一个自动喷水灭火装置被启动,控制了与一个压缩氢气瓶有关的火灾。

当地社区和大学校园的急救人员迅速赶到现场。一旦伤员得到救治,现场得到保护,救灾工作的重点首先是评估潜在的危险（电气,火灾,危险品等）。校园工作人员彻夜工作,用木板封住窗户,隔离水电供应,清理瓦砾,并以其他方式确保受影响实验室的安全。次日上午,大楼重新向住户开放。爆炸下方实验室的喷淋水造成轻微水渍,但没有设备受损。

该实验室的研究对象是在氧气环境下无法存活的土壤细菌。因此,研究工作是在一个可以控制空气中化学成分的塑料室内进行的。爆炸发生在其中一个塑料室的安装过程中。试验室基本上是一个塑料袋,容积约为两立方米。设置程序要求使用氮气三次将正常大气中的空气从袋中排出,留下极少量的残余氧气。然后在钯催化剂的作用下与氢气反应生成水,从而除去剩余的少量氧气。

在第一次吹扫过程中,氢气被错误地引入了塑料袋。结果,由于存在相对较多的氧气,袋内氢气浓度达到了爆炸水平。点火源很可能是燃烧室内的电源或钯催化剂温度过高。爆炸后观察到的燃烧模式表明,火是在催化剂的位置点燃的,但这并不排除火花参与其中的可能性。涉及的氢气量不可能超过一磅,这是压缩气瓶满载时的容量。

调查发现了导致爆炸发生的几个程序和设计问题： 1.

程序的第一步是确保从氮气和氢气压缩气瓶引出的管路是紧密的,没有任何泄漏。具体做法是打开水箱给管路加压,但将末端阀门保持在 ""关闭 ""位置。然后在每个连接处涂上肥皂水,看看是否有气泡,如果有气泡则表明有泄漏。检查完成后,研究技术人员忘记在开始三次氮气吹扫之前关闭氢气罐。
两个压缩气瓶都是通过一个 ""T ""型接头的共用管道连接到舱内的。必须手动打开末端的阀门,才能将气体引入塑料袋。通常情况下,""T ""型接头内有一个拨动开关,可用于将氮气或氢气（但不能同时将氮气和氢气）导入舱内。在过去的某个时候,由于没有合适的部件,因此爆炸发生时使用的 ""T ""型接口没有拨动开关。如果当时有拨动开关,就不可能发生爆炸。
人们不需要使用纯氢来清除氧气。替代纯氢的一种方法是购买 95% 氮和 5% 氢的混合物。由于氢气在空气中的爆炸浓度较低,约为 4%,因此即使过早错误地将气体引入试验室,这种替代混合物也不太可能产生爆炸气氛。此前,实验室曾尝试使用氢气和氧气传感器作为预防措施,以便在舱内出现爆炸气氛时发出警报。然而,事实证明这种气氛具有腐蚀性,导致传感器读数不准确,从而导致舱内出现危险的混合气体。如果在试验室联机时就有传感器,爆炸同样不太可能发生。

有许多因素减轻了损失,并使建筑活动相对较快地恢复正常： 1.

实验室小组实行了良好的内务管理,从而将爆炸造成的二次影响降至最低。
实验室门外张贴了有关实验室危险的应急信息,这对应急人员很有帮助。
大楼的应急行动计划确定了出口路线和紧急情况下的疏散计划。大楼内的人员都及时遵守了该计划。
在最近的大楼改建过程中,对实验室的公用设施进行了重新配置,使每个实验室都可以隔离。水电设施的重新配置使得受影响实验室的服务被切断,而楼内其余实验室的服务仍可继续运行。
当地急救人员和校园工作人员之间的合作非常出色。这种合作方式建立在为加强工作关系而举行的演习和协调会议的基础上。","None

Emergency responders were called to the scene. To stabilize the tank, the remaining hydrogen was removed from the tank except for a small volume in the heel of the tank that could not be removed manually. The tank vacuum was lost. Firemen sprayed the tank with water and directed a stream onto the fire exiting the vent stack. The water was channeled directly into the open vent stack, and the exiting residual hydrogen gas (between -423 F and -402 F) caused the water in the vent stack to freeze. The water freezing caused the vent stack to be sealed off, disabling the only exit for the cold hydrogen gas. After a time, the residual hydrogen gas in the tank warmed up, causing the tank to over-pressurize and rupture with an explosion known as a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).

检查期间","Many accidents reported from paper mills have much in common with this incident. Microorganisms in the process water with pulp produce hydrogen gas that mixes with air to form an explosive atmosphere. The ignition source is typically sparks produced by hot work, but ignition by electrostatic discharges in a cloud of mist in a storage tower has also been reported (see Explosion Caused by Microbial Hydrogen Formation).Provided the hazard posed by bacterial hydrogen production has been recognized, there are several preventive and/or mitigating measures that can be considered for reducing the risk:	It is advantageous to avoid anaerobic and stagnant conditions in the solution by providing sufficient circulation and/or aeration (bubbling air through the solution), but this requires monitoring and could result in foaming or generation of biogas.	The formation of an explosive atmosphere may be avoided by providing sufficient natural or forced ventilation to keep the hydrogen concentration below the lower flammability limit (LFL), or by using an open-top floating roof tank to remove the space where an explosive mixture could form.	Forced ventilation can be used, but this solution requires monitoring, and care must be taken to avoid introducing a potential ignition source.	The free space above the liquid level can be blanketed with an inert gas to prevent the formation of an explosive mixture, but this is a relatively expensive solution that requires monitoring, and the inert atmosphere will promote anaerobic conditions that favor bacterial hydrogen production.	Strict enforcement of hot work procedures, including gas measurements and the use of non-sparking tools, may prevent certain ignition sources, and especially those that are directly associated with personnel risk.	Technical solutions such as grounding to prevent build-up of electrostatic charges and installation of flame arresters on all openings in the tank to prevent ignition by lightning, etc. can also reduce the risk, but the possibility of having an explosive atmosphere inside the tank should still be regarded as a severe hazard.	Risk management strategies should include a continuous focus on preventive maintenance, mandatory safety training for all workers, regular reviews of risk assessments, and learning from previous accidents in related industries.
造纸厂报告的许多事故都与这起事件有许多共同之处。纸浆加工水中的微生物会产生氢气,氢气与空气混合后形成爆炸性气体。点火源通常是高温作业产生的火花,但也有报道称储藏塔中的云雾通过静电放电点燃（见微生物氢气形成引起的爆炸）。只要认识到细菌产氢带来的危险,就可以考虑采取以下几种预防和/或缓解措施来降低风险：通过提供足够的循环和/或通气（在溶液中鼓气）来避免溶液中出现厌氧和停滞状态是有好处的,但这需要监控,并可能导致起泡或产生沼气。可通过提供足够的自然通风或强制通风,使氢气浓度低于可燃性下限 (LFL),或使用敞顶浮顶罐来消除可能形成爆炸性混合物的空间,从而避免形成爆炸性气氛。可以使用强制通风,但这种解决方案需要监控,而且必须注意避免引入潜在的点火源。液面以上的自由空间可以用惰性气体覆盖,以防止形成爆炸性混合物,但这是一个相对昂贵的解决方案,需要监控,而且惰性气氛会促进有利于细菌产氢的厌氧条件。严格执行高温作业程序,包括气体测量和使用无火花工具,可以防止某些火源,特别是与人员风险直接相关的火源。技术解决方案,如接地以防止静电荷积聚,在罐体的所有开口处安装阻火器以防止雷电点燃等,也可以降低风险,但罐体内部存在爆炸性气体的可能性仍应被视为严重危险。风险管理策略应包括持续关注预防性维护,对所有工人进行强制性安全培训,定期审查风险评估以及吸取相关行业以往事故的教训。","A fatal accident took place at an onshore processing facility for slop water from the offshore petroleum industry.

Drilling fluids, or mud, are typically oil-water emulsions consisting of base oil (continuous phase), water (dispersed phase), and emulsifying agents. Used drilling mud, or slop, is mud enriched with water and rock cuttings from drilling --- typically 60-80% water, 10-20% emulated base oil, and 10-20% rock cuttings. The used drilling fluids are collected in slop tanks on oil platforms and later shipped to onshore facilities for further processing.

On the day of the accident, two operators were trying to remove the lid from a manhole on top of a 1600-cubic meter storage tank. However, they were not able to unscrew the rusted bolts holding the lid in place, and decided to use an angle grinder equipped with a cutting disc to cut the bolts. Shortly after the cutting began, an explosion occurred inside the tank. The explosion caused sections of the weld between the tank wall and the tank roof to rupture. The most serious damage to the tank roof was in the vicinity of the manhole. One of the operators was thrown over the railing and was killed. No other tanks in the tank farm were damaged. T

he accident investigation focused on finding the direct causes of the accident, and in particular on identifying the fuel component in the explosive mixture. A sample of base oil collected from the liquid surface inside the tank was tested by an external laboratory, and the closed cup flash point according to ASTM D6450 and ISO-2719 was determined to be 92° C. Hence, there was no reason to suspect that oil vapors played a significant role in this accident.

The liquid surface contained small bubbles trapped in a thin oil film, and gas chromatography (GC) revealed that the primary constituent in these bubbles was hydrogen gas. Microbiological analysis by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope and quantification of DNA sequences by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) showed extremely high biological activity: more than 100 million bacteria per milliliter. Most of the organisms identified in the solution belonged to groups of fermenting bacteria: Clostridia (Acetobacterium woodii), Bacilli (Alkaliebacterium, Desemzia), Fusobacteria (Propionigenium/Ilyobacter), and Spirochaeta. These are all capable of producing hydrogen under anaerobic conditions as part of the energy metabolism. The solution contained only about 0.1% metanogene bacteria: Methanosaeta (Metanofollis limninatans), Methanogenium and Methanoplanus. This is consistent with the negligible content of methane observed in the GC analysis. Hence, the fuel was hydrogen gas produced by bacterial fermentation of hydrocarbons inside the tank. Unfortunately, the growth substrate that sustained the high bacteriological activity could not be unambiguously identified from analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The ignition source was most likely mechanical sparks produced by the angle grinder, which could have entered the tank through an open 6-inch inspection hatch on the roof of the tank. This is consistent with the very low minimum ignition energy of hydrogen-air mixtures.
海上石油工业的泔水陆上处理设施发生了一起致命事故。

钻井液或泥浆通常是油水乳化液,由基础油（连续相）,水（分散相）和乳化剂组成。使用过的钻井泥浆或泔水是富含水和钻井岩石切屑的泥浆 -- 通常 60-80% 为水,10-20% 为仿真基础油,10-20% 为岩石切屑。使用过的钻井液被收集到石油平台上的泔水罐中,然后运往陆上设施进行进一步处理。

事故当天,两名操作员正试图从一个 1600 立方米储油罐顶部的人孔中取出盖子。但是,他们无法拧下固定盖子的生锈螺栓,于是决定使用装有切割盘的角磨机切割螺栓。切割开始后不久,罐内发生了爆炸。爆炸导致罐壁和罐顶之间的部分焊缝破裂。罐顶最严重的损坏位于人孔附近。一名操作员被抛出栏杆,不幸身亡。油库中没有其他油罐受损。T.

事故调查的重点是找出事故的直接原因,特别是查明爆炸混合物中的燃料成分。从罐内液面收集的基础油样品由外部实验室进行了测试,根据 ASTM D6450 和 ISO-2719 标准,确定闭杯闪点为 92°C。

液体表面含有夹在薄油膜中的小气泡,气相色谱法（GC）显示这些气泡的主要成分是氢气。通过外荧光显微镜直接计数和定量聚合酶链式反应（Q-PCR）对 DNA 序列进行定量的微生物分析表明,生物活性极高：每毫升有超过 1 亿个细菌。在溶液中发现的大多数生物都属于发酵菌群： 梭状芽孢杆菌（木醋杆菌）,芽孢杆菌（碱性杆菌,德森氏菌）,镰刀菌（丙酸杆菌/伊利杆菌）和螺旋体。这些细菌都能在厌氧条件下产生氢气,作为能量代谢的一部分。溶液中只含有约 0.1%的甲烷菌： Methanosaeta (Metanofollis limninatans),Methanogenium 和 Methanoplanus。这与气相色谱分析中观察到的甲烷含量微乎其微是一致的。因此,燃料是罐内碳氢化合物经细菌发酵产生的氢气。遗憾的是,通过气相色谱-质谱（GC-MS）分析,无法明确确定维持高细菌活性的生长基质。点火源很可能是角磨机产生的机械火花,这些火花可能通过罐顶一个打开的 6 英寸检查舱口进入罐内。这与氢气-空气混合物极低的最小点火能量相吻合。","Sparks from angle grinder

The toppled vent line did not shear or tear, but sustained a kink that restricted hydrogen flow and created a back pressure on the vessel relief system.

Repair efforts were hampered by the potential for cold hydrogen gas, a flammability hazard, in the work area. Shut off or redirection of the hydrogen was not possible, and variable breezes made set up of safe zones uncertain. A protocol had not been prepared for this scenario.

运行期间","1. The trailer involved in the incident used a frangible burst disk based upon the proprietary metal compound designated as Inconel #600. Random sampling of similar pressure relief devices from the same trailer showed that all of them failed at pressures below design specification, indicating that all were adversely affected by exposure to the combination of stresses and the product lading (hydrogen). Examination of all other hydrogen trailers in the supplier's fleet confirmed that different (Carpenter 20-based) pressure relief devices were in service.2. There has been no specific industry guidance on the type of pressure relief device materials in terms of their metallurgical makeup, but only the pressure ratings associated with the DOT rating of the tubes to which they are attached. This is based upon 5/3 of the marked DOT service pressure of the tube (e.g., 2400 psi tube X 5 ÷ 3 = 4000 psi pressure relief device rating).3. The cause of the frangible disk failure was an anomaly. All frangible disks on the trailer were replaced. Prior to placing tube trailer back into hydrogen service, all tube trailer appurtenances were examined for leaks using nitrogen at two succeeding pressures and standard leak detection fluid. A third and final examination was performed at full settled pressure before releasing the tube trailer back into hydrogen service.
1. 发生事故的拖车使用的是一种易碎爆破片,其基础是一种名为 Inconel #600 的专有金属化合物。对同一辆拖车上的类似泄压装置进行的随机抽样显示,所有泄压装置都在低于设计规范的压力下失效,这表明所有泄压装置都受到了应力和装载产品（氢气）的不利影响。对供应商车队中所有其他氢气拖车的检查证实,不同的（基于 Carpenter 20 的）泄压装置都在使用中。2. 2. 对于泄压装置材料的冶金成分类型,业界没有具体的指导意见,只有与泄压装置所连接管道的 DOT 等级相关的压力等级。其依据是管子标注的 DOT 使用压力的 5/3（例如,2400 psi 管 X 5 ÷ 3 = 4000 psi 泄压装置额定值）。3. 易碎盘故障的原因是异常。拖车上的所有易碎盘均已更换。在将拖管车重新投入氢气服务之前,使用氮气和标准检漏液对拖管车的所有附件进行了连续两次泄漏检查。在将拖车重新投入氢气服务之前,在完全稳定的压力下进行了第三次也是最后一次检查。","A pressure relief device (frangible burst disk) on one of a hydrogen delivery tube trailer's 26 tubes failed prematurely and released hydrogen while filling a hydrogen storage tank at a government facility (see Attachment 1). Prior to the filling process, all procedures and safety checks, including connection to the facility's regulator/distribution control system with leak checking and follow-up verification of leak checking by facility personnel, were completed (see Attachment 2 for more details). During the filling process, a person walking near the facility heard the noise of escaping gas that included occasional popping sounds typical of bursts of gas release. Facility personnel were alerted and the tube trailer vendor's incident response team was dispatched to the incident location.

The hydrogen leak was safely contained and mitigated by the tube trailer vendor's incident response team. On arrival, the response team first noted a decrease in pressure from the shipped pressure of 2100 to 1700 psi (145 to 117 bar) at the tube trailer's common supply manifold. The hydrogen leak was located to a single tube on the tube trailer coming from a burst disk (over-pressure-protection rupture disk). The hydrogen gas from the tube trailer to the common supply manifold was shut off by closing the isolation valve on each of the 26 tubes. The leaking tube was vented to atmosphere by attaching a 10-ft (3-meter) vertically oriented pipe downstream and opening the leaking tube's isolation valve. After the leaking tube was completely vented, the leaking tube's isolation valve was closed and the vent pipe was removed. The final step was to disconnect the tube trailer from the facility's regulator distribution control and move it outside of the facility's designated hydrogen storage area. No property damage or injuries occurred from this incident.

The over-pressure-protection burst disks on each of the tube trailer's 26 tubes had a rated burst pressure of 4000 psi (275 bar). The purpose of the pressure relief device is to operate in accordance with 49 CFR §173.301(f). The pressure relief device must be capable of preventing rupture of the normally filled cylinder when subject to a fire test conducted in accordance with CGA C-14. Based on CGA C-4, the pressure relief device is designed to operate with a frangible burst disk in combination with a eutectic material, thereby minimizing the incidence of unintentional release by only operating in the event of a fire. The frangible (bursting) disk is designed to burst at 5/3 the container's pressure and is backed by eutectic material that melts at 100 °C (212 °F). The frangible burst disk material used (Inconel #600 series) had been the predominant material at the time the tube trailer was last requalified.

Post-event analysis of the incident included removal of the tube trailer's affected over-pressure-protection frangible disk. Inspection of the disk determined that it had ruptured and the disk opening was separated from the rupture disk holder. No visible indication or presence of corrosion or contamination was found. Subsequent testing of other pressure relief devices also showed disk rupture at lower-than-expected pressures.

The probable cause of this event was that the burst disk was degraded by the synergic events of exposure to hydrogen and stress associated with the working pressure involved. A contributing factor in this incident was the burst disk Inconel #600 material that has a high hardness/tensile strength, making it more susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC). It should also be noted that the leak detection step prior to starting the hydrogen fill process is useful for finding leaks in threaded connections, but it could not have detected or predicted the premature failure of the burst disk.

氢气泄漏被安全地控制住,并由管道拖车供应商的事故应急小组加以缓解。到达现场后,应急小组首先注意到,在拖管车的共用供应歧管处,压力从发货时的 2100 至 1700 psi（145 至 117 bar）有所下降。氢气泄漏点位于管道拖车上的一根管道,来自一个爆破片（过压保护爆破片）。通过关闭 26 根管道中每一根管道上的隔离阀,切断了从管道拖车到共用供应歧管的氢气。在下游安装一根 10 英尺（3 米）长的垂直管道,打开泄漏管道的隔离阀,将泄漏管道排出大气。泄漏管道完全排空后,关闭泄漏管道的隔离阀,拆除排气管。最后一步是将管拖车与设施的调节器分配控制装置断开,并将其移出设施指定的氢气储存区。此次事故未造成财产损失或人员伤亡。

拖车 26 根管道上的过压保护爆破片的额定爆破压力为 4000 磅/平方英寸（275 巴）。泄压装置的作用是按照美国联邦法规第 49 编第 173. 301(f). 泄压装置必须能够在按照 CGA C-14 进行火灾试验时防止正常充气的气瓶破裂。根据 CGA C-4,泄压装置的设计是将易碎爆破片与共晶材料结合使用,只有在发生火灾时才起作用,从而最大限度地减少意外泄漏的发生。易碎（爆破）盘的设计爆破压力为容器压力的 5/3,并以在 100 °C (212 °F) 下熔化的共晶材料为支撑。所使用的易碎爆破片材料（铬镍铁合金 #600 系列）是拖车上次重新认证时的主要材料。

对事故的事后分析包括拆除拖管车受影响的过压保护易碎盘。经检查发现,该防爆片已经破裂,防爆片开口与防爆片支架分离。没有发现明显的腐蚀或污染迹象或存在。随后对其他泄压装置的测试也显示,在压力低于预期的情况下,爆破片破裂。

造成这一事件的可能原因是,爆破片在氢气和工作压力的协同作用下发生了退化。造成这一事件的一个因素是爆破片的 Inconel #600 材料具有较高的硬度/拉伸强度,因此更容易出现应力腐蚀开裂 (SCC)。还应该指出的是,开始充氢过程之前的泄漏检测步骤对于发现螺纹连接中的泄漏非常有用,但它无法检测或预测爆裂盘的过早失效。","None

There are wrenches specifically designed to remove compressed gas cylinder caps. The lab had such a wrench and it was the one used by staff at the time of the incident. (See attached photos.)	The wrench designed for the cylinder caps is short and often does not provide enough leverage to easily open the cylinder caps. Staff indicated that they often reverse the wrench, pushing it through one of the cylinder cap openings to gain additional leverage on cylinder cap lids. They indicated this was a common practice with exceptionally difficult cylinder cap lids and they did not believe it could interfere with the cylinder valve.	The training program did not prohibit using the valve cap wrench in the manner it was used.	The cylinder was empty when it was received by the hydrogen supplier. The valve and pressure relief device did not show any leaks when the cylinder was pressurized with helium. The supplier believes that on the day of the incident, the cylinder valve was bumped open with the wrench used to remove the cap.	Other laboratory staff noted that they only heard part of the page to evacuate the lab due to background noise in their labs, but they did evacuate immediately anyway.	The company maintains written descriptions of how to safely handle compressed gas cylinders in their job safety analysis sheets and their safe work practices handbook. Neither reference prohibited the valve cap wrench being used in the manner it was.	Visual inspection of the analytical lab was done to confirm that all staff had exited the laboratory, but formal written accountability was not conducted.	Facilities staff determined that it was not possible to adjust air flow within the analytical lab from outside the lab because all the controls are located inside the lab.CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:	Obtain different wrench that provides adequate torque on cylinder cap, but cannot interfere with valve.	Train staff on how to use new wrench.	Have staff loosen cylinder caps outside of the building before bringing the cylinder into the lab.	Install cylinder station outside of the building to hold cylinders with difficult-to-open cylinder caps.	Update job safety analysis sheet to reflect new cylinder handling procedures.	Emergency pages should be made twice. For any event that could lead to a fire or explosion, staff should immediately evacuate the area and pull the closest fire alarm box.	Share lessons learned with other facilities.	Reinforce with staff the need to check offices, conference rooms, and rest rooms as they are evacuating to ensure that all staff are aware of the emergency.	Reinforce with incident commanders the need to ensure that formal written accountability is taken during an emergency.	Investigate the feasibility of relocating critical building controls outside of the analytical lab.
经验教训：压缩气瓶盖很难打开,因为螺纹中经常生锈。有一种扳手专门用来拆卸压缩气瓶盖。实验室就有这样一把扳手,事发时工作人员使用的就是这把扳手。(见附图。)为气瓶盖设计的扳手很短,往往没有足够的杠杆作用来轻松打开气瓶盖。工作人员表示,他们经常将扳手反转,将其推过一个钢瓶盖开口,以获得更多的杠杆作用来打开钢瓶盖。他们表示,这是对特别难打开的钢瓶盖的常见做法,他们不认为这会干扰钢瓶阀门。培训计划并未禁止以这种方式使用气瓶盖扳手。氢气供应商收到钢瓶时,钢瓶是空的。用氦气对气瓶加压时,阀门和泄压装置没有显示任何泄漏。供应商认为,事发当天,气瓶阀门是被用来取下瓶盖的扳手撞开的。其他实验室工作人员指出,由于实验室的背景噪音,他们只听到了撤离实验室的部分呼声,但他们还是立即撤离了实验室。公司在工作安全分析表和安全工作实践手册中对如何安全处理压缩气瓶进行了书面说明。这两份文件都没有禁止以这种方式使用阀帽扳手。对分析实验室进行了目视检查,以确认所有工作人员都已离开实验室,但没有进行正式的书面问责。设备工作人员认为,不可能从实验室外调节分析实验室内的气流,因为所有的 控制装置都在实验室内。纠正措施：购置不同的扳手,既能在气缸盖上提供足够的扭矩,又不能干扰阀门。培训员工如何使用新扳手。让工作人员在楼外松开钢瓶盖,然后再将钢瓶带入实验室。在楼外安装钢瓶站,用于放置钢瓶盖难以打开的钢瓶。更新工作安全分析表,以反映新的气瓶处理程序。紧急页面应翻阅两次。对于任何可能导致火灾或爆炸的事件,员工都应立即撤离该区域,并拉响最近的火警箱。与其他设施分享经验教训。向员工强调在疏散时需要检查办公室,会议室和休息室,以确保所有员工都了解紧急情况。向事件指挥员强调,必须确保在紧急情况下进行正式的书面问责。调查将关键的楼宇控制设施迁出分析实验室的可行性。","Two scientists were changing hydrogen gas cylinders in an analytical laboratory. They were in the process of removing the cylinder cap from the new cylinder when a loud hissing noise occurred and they quickly realized that the tank was leaking. After making a quick attempt to shut off the tank, which was not possible, they left the lab and notified their supervisor.

After checking that everyone was out of the lab, the supervisor paged all staff in the vicinity to immediately evacuate to the staging area. Facility management and ES&amp;H management were notified about the situation, and they contacted the local fire department to respond to the site in case the venting gas was ignited.

The first responders arrived quickly and spoke with facility management and the site safety officer. Everyone agreed that the best course of action was to allow the tank to vent until it was empty. The hydrogen gas supplier was called, but a specialist was unavailable at that time. Based on information from the hydrogen supplier's website and some basic estimates of the hydrogen release rate, facility staff determined that the contents of the tank should have been completely vented. A decision was made that the first responders would approach the lab in full bunker gear with SCBA and a gas detector (Lower Explosion Limit (LEL) meter) to evaluate if there was any gas present. If they heard any hissing coming from the tank or if there was any reading above ""0%"" on the LEL meter, the team would immediately pull back and reassess the situation.

Two first responders entered the lab and two were stationed as back-up. Upon entry to the lab, the first responders indicated that they did not hear any hissing and proceeded towards the cylinder with the LEL meter. Their readings confirmed that the cylinder had vented and the lab was clear and safe to enter. The hydrogen cylinder was moved outside and secured and later returned to the supplier.
两名科学家正在分析实验室更换氢气瓶。他们正在从新钢瓶上取下钢瓶盖时,突然听到一声巨大的嘶嘶声,他们很快意识到钢瓶正在泄漏。他们迅速尝试关闭气罐,但无法关闭,于是他们离开实验室并通知了主管。

在确认所有人都已离开实验室后,主管呼唤附近的所有工作人员立即撤离到中转区。设备管理部门和 ES&amp;H 管理部门获悉这一情况后,联系了当地消防部门赶赴现场,以防排出的气体被点燃。

第一批救援人员迅速赶到现场,并与设备管理人员和现场安全员进行了交谈。大家一致认为,最好的办法是让氢气罐排空。他们给氢气供应商打了电话,但当时没有专家。根据氢气供应商网站上提供的信息和对氢气释放率的一些基本估计,工厂工作人员确定储气罐内的气体应该已经完全排空。于是决定,第一批应急人员将穿戴全套掩体装备,配备 SCBA 和气体检测仪（爆炸下限 (LEL) 计）接近实验室,以评估是否存在任何气体。如果他们听到罐子里发出嘶嘶声,或者 LEL 测量仪上的读数超过 ""0%"",小组就会立即后撤,重新评估情况。

两名急救人员进入实验室,另外两名作为后备人员。进入实验室后,急救人员表示没有听到任何嘶嘶声,并拿着 LEL 测量仪走向钢瓶。他们的读数证实,氢气瓶已经排气,实验室内没有任何危险,可以安全进入。氢气瓶被移到室外并固定好,随后归还给了供应商。","None

According to witnesses, the tractor-semitrailer then went out of control and left the roadway, coming to rest approximately 300 feet (91 meters) from the point of impact. As a result of rotational torque and impact, the end of one tube was sheared off at the bulkhead and left the tube bundle. During the process, some of the tubes, valves, piping, and fittings at the rear of the semitrailer were damaged and released hydrogen. The hydrogen ignited and burned the rear of the semitrailer. In the meantime, the pickup truck had also run off the road and its fuel line ruptured, resulting in the truck being destroyed by fire.

The tractor-semitrailer driver was killed as a result of blunt force trauma. The driver of the pickup truck received non-life-threatening injuries. Residents of five homes in the vicinity of the accident were asked to evacuate, and the highway was closed for more than 12 hours. Damage, cleanup, and lost revenues were estimated at $155,000.

Numerous emergency personnel responded to the accident. First responders on the scene were volunteer fireman and initially positioned themselves in direct line with the forward ends of the hydrogen tubes to put out the fire and extricate the truck driver. When the HazMat team arrived, they decided to take a more defensive position away from a direct line with the forward ends of the hydrogen tubes and concentrate on cooling the tubes from a safe distance. An emergency response team associated with the hydrogen carrier responded with the equipment necessary to flare the residual pressure in the tubes. Approximately four hours after the accident occurred, the local fire personnel demobilized and departed. Approximately 10 hours from the time of the accident, all tubes had been vented of hydrogen and the fire was out.
下午早些时候,一辆向北行驶的拖拉机半挂车被一辆向北行驶的皮卡车撞倒,皮卡车转向半挂车的右后轴,拖拉机半挂车装有水平安装的氢气管,氢气压力约为 2400 磅/平方英寸（166 巴）。据目击者称,牵引车-半挂车随后失去控制,驶离路面,在距离撞击点约 300 英尺（91 米）处停下。由于旋转扭矩和撞击,一根管子的末端在隔板处被剪断,离开了管束。在此过程中,半拖车尾部的一些管子,阀门,管道和配件受损,并释放出氢气。氢气点燃并烧毁了半挂车的尾部。与此同时,皮卡车也冲出了路面,其燃油管破裂,导致皮卡车被大火烧毁。

牵引半挂车司机因钝器击伤死亡。皮卡车司机受了伤,没有生命危险。事故附近的五户居民被要求撤离,高速公路被关闭了 12 个多小时。损失,清理和收入损失估计为 15.5 万美元。

许多紧急救援人员对事故做出了反应。第一批赶到现场的是志愿消防员,他们一开始将自己置于氢气管前端的正前方,以扑灭大火并救出卡车司机。当 HazMat 小组到达现场时,他们决定采取防御性更强的姿势,远离氢气管的前端,在安全距离外集中冷却氢气管。与氢气运输船有关的一个应急小组带着必要的设备赶来,对氢气管中的残余压力进行燃烧。事故发生约 4 小时后,当地消防人员撤离。从事故发生时算起,大约 10 个小时后,所有管道中的氢气都被排出,火也被扑灭。","None

Verify that maintenance procedures used for liquid hydrogen systems meet the requirements of the manufacturer. Ensure that personnel performing maintenance have the necessary training to work on liquid hydrogen pumps. Ensure that liquid hydrogen pump maintenance procedures are in the training system and that work performed is documented in the maintenance system.	Install an hour meter in pump systems to ensure that maintenance can be performed based on hours of service instead of on a fixed schedule. Program the recommended maintenance interval into the maintenance system.	Communicate the incident to all company team members through the safety bulletin and discussions at safety meetings/conference calls.	Share best practices with other company entities that have liquid hydrogen pumping installations. Send this report to other company entities operating or installing this type of equipment.	Make changes required by the fire department to resume operation and have drawings approved by state PE.	The operator’s quick response and training of emergency shutdown procedures at this facility prevented this from developing into a much larger and more serious incident.	Remember that gaseous hydrogen typically propagates much faster in air than cold liquid hydrogen. Cold liquid hydrogen has a density near air and instead of dissipating up quickly, it may propagate more slowly from the source of the leak. In this incident, the cold liquid hydrogen remained near ground level until it was warmed by the surrounding conditions.
升级液氢泵控制系统,以便在发生泄漏,泵气蚀或清洗气体损失等故障时,关闭泵的运行并保护系统。确认液氢系统的维护程序符合制造商的要求。确保从事维护工作的人员接受过必要的培训,能够操作液氢泵。确保培训系统中包含液氢泵维护程序,并在维护系统中记录所执行的工作。在泵系统中安装小时计,确保可根据服务时间而非固定时间表进行维护。将建议的维护间隔编入维护系统。通过安全公告和安全会议/电话会议上的讨论,向公司所有团队成员通报事故情况。与拥有液氢泵装置的其他公司实体分享最佳实践。将此报告发送给运营或安装此类设备的其他公司实体。按照消防部门的要求进行改动,以恢复运行,并使图纸获得州 PE 的批准。操作员的快速反应以及对该设施进行的紧急停机程序培训,避免了这起事故演变成更大,更严重的事故。请记住,气态氢在空气中的传播速度通常比冷液态氢快得多。冷液态氢的密度接近空气,它不会迅速消散,而是会从泄漏源头缓慢扩散。在这起事故中,冷液态氢一直停留在地面附近,直到被周围环境加热。","A leaking liquid hydrogen cryogenic pump shaft during the process of filling a gaseous tube delivery trailer to 2400 psi at a liquid hydrogen transfilling location caused a series of explosions and a fire. After approximately 30 minutes of filling, the operator heard a single loud explosion and then saw flames and ripples from heat generation near the ground in the hydrogen fill area. The operator quickly actuated the emergency alarm system that shut down the cryogenic pump and closed the air-actuated valves on the cryogenic pump supply line. After this shutdown, three smaller explosions were heard as well as the sound of gas releasing from a safety relief valve. The fire department was called to the scene and participated in the final shutdown of the hydrogen system as the fire was extinguished prior to their arrival. The partially filled tube trailer (~ 1800 psi) was disconnected and moved away from the incident area to a safe location. There were no injuries from this incident and only a small amount of equipment damage with some floor charring.

A leak at the cold end packing of the liquid hydrogen pump was determined to be the source of the hydrogen that exploded and burned. The ignition source was most likely static electricity or frictional energy on the cryogenic pump shaft. A Notice of Violation was issued by the fire department that prevents the start-up of the liquid hydrogen system until all necessary safeguards are in place to re-start the system. A thorough investigation followed this incident and a summary is provided in Attachment 1. Highlights in Attachment 1 include findings of the cryogenic pump disassembly, operation of the shutdown pressure switch, speculation that the nitrogen purge system was inoperative, as well as more incident details.
在一个液氢灌注地点,一个液氢低温泵轴在将气态管输送拖车灌注到 2400 psi 的过程中发生泄漏,引发了一系列爆炸和火灾。充填大约 30 分钟后,操作员听到一声巨大的爆炸声,然后看到氢气充填区地面附近有火焰和发热产生的波纹。操作员迅速启动紧急报警系统,关闭了低温泵,并关闭了低温泵供气管上的气动阀门。关闭之后,听到了三声较小的爆炸声以及安全泄压阀释放气体的声音。消防部门接到报警后赶到现场,参与了氢气系统的最后关闭工作,因为在他们到达之前火已被扑灭。部分充气的拖车管（约 1800 psi）被断开,并从事故区域移到安全地点。此次事故未造成人员伤亡,仅有少量设备受损,部分地板烧焦。

经确定,液氢泵冷端密封泄漏是氢气爆炸和燃烧的源头。点火源很可能是低温泵轴上的静电或摩擦能量。消防部门发出了违规通知,要求在重新启动液氢系统之前,必须采取一切必要的保障措施。事件发生后进行了彻底调查,调查摘要见附录 1。附件 1 中的重点包括低温泵拆卸结果,关闭压力开关的运行情况,氮气吹扫系统失灵的推测以及更多事件细节。","None

运行期间","It is important to understand the requirements and standards associated with safe equipment design (especially electrical equipment containing an internal ignition source with flammable gas) in potentially explosive atmosphere environments. Misinterpretation of requirements and standards can lead to serious consequences. If the application of a standard is not fully understood, it is advisable to contact the author of the standard to remove any misunderstanding and not try to interpret the rules.	Gas detection instrument location is critical to proper functioning. Light gases like hydrogen rise in air, and gas detection needs to be at the high point in the potential source area so that even small leaks can be detected. Various alarm/action thresholds below the lower flammability limit (LFL) of the flammable gas give additional warning of a possible problem in the event of a gas leak. The following is a summary of how equipment involved in this incident should have been installed.	The gas chromatograph should not be installed in a sealed cabinet, but should follow explosive atmosphere design standards to have forced ventilation with a minimum flow rate of 12 times the cabinet volume per hour and to exhaust outside the building. With this change, the analysis room can remain in its current configuration and it does not fall under the explosive atmosphere regulations.	The fixed gas detector must be installed in the cabinet sealed volume, and must comply with explosive atmosphere regulations. The gas detector must be connected to an interlock system and set with two threshold levels; the first at 25% of the LFL (which sends an alarm) and the second at 50% of the LFL (which closes the hydrogen isolation safety valve). For this gas detector, the 100% LFL threshold level is set at 4% hydrogen in air.	To minimize the consequences of a possible leak of hydrogen inside the cabinet, it is recommended that the hydrogen isolation safety valve be installed outside the analysis room.	The explosive atmosphere regulations also require the installation of a door switch that stops the supply of electricity and flammable gases whenever the door is opened (for example, when performing maintenance). This door switch limits the risk of creating an explosive atmosphere in the room that is not regulated under explosive atmosphere standards.
了解与潜在爆炸性环境中的安全设备设计（尤其是包含内部点火源和易燃气体的电气设备）相关的要求和标准非常重要。对要求和标准的误解会导致严重后果。如果不能完全理解标准的应用,建议联系标准的制定者,消除误解,不要试图解释规则。气体检测仪器的位置对于正常工作至关重要。氢气等轻质气体会在空气中上升,因此气体检测仪需要安装在潜在泄漏源区域的高点,这样即使很小的泄漏也能被检测到。低于可燃气体可燃性下限 (LFL) 的各种警报/行动阈值可在气体泄漏时就可能出现的问题发出额外警告。以下是此次事故所涉设备的安装方式概要。气相色谱仪不应安装在密封柜中,而应按照爆炸性气体环境设计标准进行强制通风,流量至少为每小时 12 倍的柜体容积,并向建筑物外排气。有了这一改动,分析室就可以保持目前的配置,也就不属于爆炸性气体环境规定的范围。固定式气体检测仪必须安装在机柜的密封容积内,并且必须符合爆炸性气体环境规定。气体探测器必须与联锁系统连接,并设置两个阈值水平；第一个阈值水平为 LFL 的 25%（发出警报）,第二个阈值水平为 LFL 的 50%（关闭氢隔离安全阀）。对于该气体检测仪,100% LFL 临界值设定为空气中含 4% 的氢气。为尽量减少柜内氢气泄漏的后果,建议将氢气隔离安全阀安装在分析室外。爆炸性气体环境法规还要求安装一个门开关,只要打开门（例如,在进行维护时）,门开关就会停止供电和可燃气体的供应。这种门开关可限制房间内产生不受爆炸性气体环境标准管制的爆炸性气体环境的风险。","An explosion occurred at a chemical plant in an analysis room containing various analyzer instruments, including a gas chromatograph supplied with hydrogen. A contract operator was performing work to install a new vent line to a benzene analyzer that was part of a group of CO2 analyzers, but separate and unrelated to the gas chromatograph. During the process of this work, a plant supervisor accompanying the contract operator doing the work had an indication of flammable gas present on a portable detector. This was in conflict with the fixed gas detector in the analysis room that was indicating that no flammable gas was present. As a precaution, the plant supervisor immediately cut off the hydrogen supply and, along with the contract operator, began the normal task of determining if there was a gas leak in the room. While investigating the potential gas leak, the gas chromatograph that was housed in a cabinet exploded and the nearby contract operator was injured in the chest and hand when the cabinet door burst open and received minor burns to the hair and face from the fire. See Attachments 1 and 2 for diagrams and photos.

The plant control room was immediately notified by radio of the incident and subsequently called emergency services to send an ambulance to treat the injured contract operator. The ambulance arrived at the plant in approximately 15 minutes and, as a precautionary measure, the contract operator was transported to a nearby hospital for further assessment. There was no internal damage or damage to the airways and no additional medical injuries were found. Minor damage to the gas chromatograph and cabinet occurred from the explosion/fire.

The flame ionization gas chromatograph (used in this application to measure the quality of specific hydrocarbon) was installed in a small cabinet that was not rated for explosive atmosphere application, and the natural ventilation through cabinet louvers was insufficient. In addition, the cabinet louvers were not connected to an exhaust duct, allowing gases to escape into a room not rated for explosive atmosphere. The analysis room's fixed gas detector was located too far from the cabinet and was not mounted high enough to detect the small gas leak from the gas chromatograph system. The valve that shuts off the hydrogen supply was located near the gas chromatograph's inlet, and it would be better located outside of the analysis room. The origin of the leak has not yet been pinpointed, but the explosion occurred either in the gas chromatograph or in its cabinet. These deficiencies have since been corrected and are shown in the diagrams presented in Attachment 1. Photos of the gas chromatograph and associated cabinet are shown in Attachment 2.
一家化工厂的分析室内发生爆炸,室内有各种分析仪器,包括一台氢气气相色谱仪。一名合同操作员正在为一台苯分析仪安装新的通风管道,该分析仪是一组二氧化碳分析仪的一部分,但与气相色谱仪分开且无关。在工作过程中,陪同合同操作员工作的一名工厂主管发现便携式检测仪显示存在可燃气体。这与分析室的固定式气体检测仪显示不存在可燃气体相矛盾。为谨慎起见,工厂主管立即切断了氢气供应,并与合同操作员一起开始执行正常任务,确定分析室是否存在气体泄漏。在调查可能的气体泄漏时,放在柜子里的气相色谱仪发生爆炸,柜门突然打开,附近的合同操作员胸部和手部受伤,头发和脸部被火轻微烧伤。图表和照片见附件 1 和 2。

工厂控制室立即通过无线电获知了这一事件,并随后呼叫急救服务部门派救护车来救治受伤的合同操作员。救护车在大约 15 分钟后抵达工厂,作为预防措施,合同操作员被送往附近的医院接受进一步评估。没有发现内部损伤或呼吸道损伤,也没有发现其他医疗伤害。爆炸/火灾对气相色谱仪和橱柜造成了轻微损坏。

火焰离子化气相色谱仪（在此应用中用于测量特定碳氢化合物的质量）安装在一个小柜子里,该柜子不符合爆炸性环境应用的额定值,而且柜子百叶窗的自然通风不足。此外,柜子的百叶窗没有连接到排气管道,导致气体逸散到不符合爆炸性气体环境要求的房间内。分析室的固定气体检测器距离机柜太远,安装高度不够,无法检测到气相色谱仪系统的少量气体泄漏。关闭氢气供应的阀门位于气相色谱仪入口附近,最好设在分析室外面。泄漏源头尚未查明,但爆炸发生在气相色谱仪或其柜子中。这些缺陷后来都得到了纠正,见附录 1 中的图表。气相色谱仪和相关柜子的照片见附录 2。","None

运行期间","1. Management must ensure that operating decisions are not based primarily on cost and production. Performance goals and operating risks must be effectively communicated to all employees. Facility management must set safe, achievable operating limits and not tolerate deviations from these limits. Risks of deviation from operating limits must be fully understood by operators. Also, management must provide an operating environment conducive for operators to follow emergency shutdown procedures when required.2. Process instrumentation and controls should be designed to consider human factors consistent with good industry practice. Hydroprocessing reactor temperature controls should be consolidated with all necessary data available in the control room. Some backup system of temperature indicators should be used so that the reactors can be operated safely in case of instrument malfunction. Each alarm system should be designed to allow critical emergency alarms to be distinguished from other operating alarms.3. Adequate supervision is needed for operators, especially to address critical or abnormal situations. Supervisors need to ensure that all required procedures are followed. Supervisors should identify and address all operating hazards and conduct thorough investigation of deviations to determine root causes and take corrective action. Equipment and job performance issues related to operating incidents should be corrected by management.4. Facilities should maintain equipment integrity and discontinue operation if integrity is compromised. Hydroprocessing operations especially need to have reliable temperature monitoring systems and emergency shutdown equipment. Equipment should be tested regularly and practice emergency drills should be held on a regular basis. Maintenance and instrumentation support should be available during start up after equipment installation or major maintenance.5. Management must ensure that operators receive regular training on the unit process operations and chemistry. For hydrocrackers, this should include training on reaction kinetics and the causes and control of temperature excursions. Operators need to be trained on the limitations of process instruments and how to handle instrument malfunctions. Facilities need to ensure that operators receive regular training on the use of the emergency shutdown systems and the need to activate these systems.6. Management must develop written operating procedures for all phases of hydrocracker operations. The procedures should include operating limits and consequences of deviation from the limits. The procedures should be reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in equipment, process chemistry, and operation. As appropriate, the procedures should be updated to include recommendations from process hazard analysis and incident investigations.7. Process hazard analysis must be based on actual equipment and operating conditions that exist at the time of the analysis. The analysis should include the failure of critical operating systems, such as temperature monitors or emergency operating systems. A Management of Change review should be conducted for all changes to equipment or processes, as necessary, and should include a safety hazard review of the changes.More information on management of change can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner and also in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
1. 管理层必须确保运营决策并非主要基于成本和产量。必须向所有员工有效传达绩效目标和运营风险。设备管理部门必须设定安全,可实现的操作极限,并且不允许偏离这些极限。操作人员必须充分了解偏离操作极限的风险。此外,管理层必须提供一个有利于操作员在必要时遵守紧急停机程序的操作环境。2. 工艺仪表和控制装置的设计应考虑到人为因素,并与良好的工业实践保持一致。应将水处理反应器的温度控制与控制室的所有必要数据整合在一起。应使用一些后备温度指示系统,以便在仪表出现故障时能安全地操作反应器。每个警报系统的设计应能将关键的紧急警报与其他运行警报区分开来。3. 需要对操作人员进行充分的监督,尤其是在处理危急或异常情况时。监管人员需要确保所有必要的程序都得到遵守。监管人员应识别并处理所有操作危险,对偏差进行彻底调查,以确定根本原因并采取纠正措施。管理层应纠正与操作事故有关的设备和工作绩效问题。4. 工厂应保持设备的完整性,并在完整性受到损害时停止运行。加氢处理操作尤其需要可靠的温度监控系统和紧急停机设备。应定期对设备进行测试,并定期进行应急演练。在设备安装或重大维护后的启动过程中,应提供维护和仪表支持。5. 5. 管理部门必须确保操作人员定期接受有关装置工艺操作和化学方面的培训。对于加氢裂化装置,培训应包括反应动力学以及温度偏差的原因和控制。操作员需要接受有关工艺仪表的局限性以及如何处理仪表故障的培训。工厂需要确保操作人员定期接受有关使用紧急关闭系统以及启动这些系统的必要性的培训。6. 管理层必须为加氢裂化装置运行的所有阶段制定书面操作程序。程序应包括操作限制和偏离限制的后果。应定期审查和更新这些程序,以反映设备,工艺化学和操作方面的变化。应酌情更新程序,以纳入流程危害分析和事故调查提出的建议。7. 工艺危害分析必须以分析时存在的实际设备和操作条件为基础。分析应包括关键操作系统的故障,如温度监控器或紧急操作系统。必要时,应对设备或工艺的所有变更进行变更管理审查,并应包括对变更的安全危害审查。有关变更管理的更多信息,请参阅 ""经验总结 ""和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A refinery hydrocracker effluent pipe section ruptured and released a mixture of gases, including hydrogen, which instantly ignited on contact with the air, causing an explosion and a fire. Excessive high temperature, likely in excess of 1400°F (760°C), initiated in one of the reactor beds spread to adjacent beds and raised the temperature and pressure of the effluent piping to the point where it failed. An operator who was checking a field temperature panel at the base of the reactor and trying to diagnose the high-temperature problem was killed. A total of 46 other plant personnel were injured and 13 of these were taken to local hospitals, treated, and released. There were no reported injuries to the public.

Property damage included an 18-inch (46-centimeter) long tear in the reactor piping, heat/fire damage to ladders/scaffolding/platforms around the rupture area and a nearby light pole, and damage to a large fire water piping. Approximately 13 pounds (5.9 kilograms) of friable asbestos insulation from the damaged piping and equipment was released into the air as particulates, but subsequent testing found asbestos levels below the detection limit and below the OSHA standard. Damage is shown in Attachment 1 (Figures 1 to 5).

The high temperature that caused the pipe rupture was not brought under control because the operators did not activate an emergency depressurization of the reactor when some internal reactor temperature readings reached 800°F (427°C) because they were confused about whether a temperature excursion was actually occurring. Their confusion was due to a variety of factors, including: fluctuating temperature readings, a discontinuation of makeup hydrogen flow to one of the reactor stages, a misleading recycle hydrogen purity analysis, and the absence of additional audible high-temperature alarms after the first high-temperature occurrence. They were attempting to verify temperatures in the reactor by having an operator obtain temperature readings from the field panels under the reactor. Poor radio communications hampered relaying these readings to the control room. Even after the operators in the control room noticed that another reactor stage inlet temperature had increased beyond 800°F (427°C), they did not depressurize but began to take steps to cool the reactor by increasing quench hydrogen flow and reducing heat input from the trim furnace.
一家炼油厂的加氢裂化器排出管段破裂,释放出包括氢气在内的混合气体,这些气体与空气接触后瞬间点燃,引发爆炸和火灾。其中一个反应器反应床产生的过高温度（可能超过 1400°F (760°C)）扩散到邻近反应床,并使流出管道的温度和压力升高,最终导致管道破裂。一名正在检查反应器底部的现场温度面板并试图诊断高温问题的操作员遇难。共有 46 名其他工厂人员受伤,其中 13 人被送往当地医院接受治疗后出院。没有公众受伤的报告。

财产损失包括反应堆管道上的一个 18 英寸（46 厘米）长的裂口,破裂区域周围的梯子/脚手架/平台和附近的灯杆的热/火损坏,以及一个大型消防水管的损坏。受损管道和设备中约有 13 磅（5. 9 千克）易碎的石棉绝缘材料以微粒形式释放到空气中,但随后的检测发现石棉含量低于检测限值,也低于 OSHA 标准。损坏情况见附录 1（图 1 至图 5）。造成管道破裂的高温并没有得到控制,因为当反应堆内部的一些温度读数达到 427°C (800°F)时,操作人员并没有启动反应堆紧急减压,因为他们对是否真的发生了温度偏移感到困惑。他们的困惑是由多种因素造成的,包括：温度读数的波动,流向反应堆某级的补给氢中断,循环氢纯度分析的误导性,以及在第一次高温发生后没有额外的高温声音警报。他们试图通过让一名操作员从反应堆下方的现场面板上获取温度读数来验证反应堆内的温度。由于无线电通信不畅,无法将这些读数转发到控制室。即使在控制室的操作人员注意到另一个反应堆级的入口温度已升至超过 427°C (800°F)之后,他们也没有进行减压,而是开始采取措施,通过增加淬火氢流量和减少从微调炉输入的热量来冷却反应堆。","None

运行期间","Redundant safety systems prevented this event from becoming an incident. The 1%-hydrogen-concentration-level-triggered fan was backed up by a 2%-hydrogen-concentration alarm. The alarm is continuously monitored (24/7) by a remote Network Operations Center (NOC).	Since this event, a pressure switch has been added to alarm in case of a fan failure and is also continuously monitored by the remote NOC.	Future standards will require two ventilation fans, one running continuously and the other triggered to start when a 1% hydrogen concentration is reached.Adequate ventilation of battery charging facilities is addressed in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website.
冗余安全系统防止了这一事件演变成事故。1% 氢浓度水平触发的风扇由 2% 氢浓度报警器提供支持。该警报由远程网络运行中心 (NOC) 持续监控（24/7）。自该事件发生后,又增加了一个压力开关,以便在风扇发生故障时发出警报,该警报也由远程网络运行中心（NOC）持续监控。未来的标准将要求有两个通风扇,一个持续运行,另一个在氢气浓度达到 1%时触发启动。本网站的 ""经验总结 ""栏目将讨论电池充电设施的充分通风问题。","A hydrogen alarm sounded when hydrogen buildup occurred in an unmanned switching room containing backup lead acid batteries after the exhaust ventilation fans failed to start at the 1% hydrogen trigger level. Failure of the ventilation fans to vent the normal off-gassing hydrogen from the lead acid batteries resulted in the hydrogen concentration in the room increasing to 2%, which triggered the hydrogen alarm. The alarm was automatically sent to an alarm-monitoring company that alerted the local fire department as well as company personnel of the condition. The fire department was dispatched to the scene and, along with company personnel, provided secondary ventilation to lower the hydrogen concentration to normal conditions. Hydrogen leakage from lead acid batteries is normal, and the procedures in place to respond to increased concentrations of hydrogen worked as designed and lowered the concentration of hydrogen gas before it became a potential problem. No injury of personnel or property damage occurred from this event.

The hydrogen alarm worked as designed and the problem was resolved without incident. Normal operations resumed when the primary ventilation fan was changed to run continuously (24 hours/day, 7 days/week). Another safety precaution was added, consisting of a pressure switch to remotely alert personnel if the room ventilation is lost (i.e., ventilation fans stop working).

 
在氢气浓度达到 1%触发水平时,排气扇未能启动,导致装有备用铅酸电池的无人值守配电室内氢气积聚,氢气警报响起。换气扇未能排出铅酸电池正常排出的氢气,导致房间内的氢气浓度上升到 2%,从而触发了氢气警报。警报被自动发送到一家警报监测公司,该公司向当地消防部门和公司人员发出警报。消防队被派往现场,与公司人员一起进行二次通风,将氢气浓度降至正常状态。铅酸电池泄漏氢气是正常现象,应对氢气浓度增加的现有程序按设计进行,在氢气成为潜在问题之前降低了氢气浓度。此次事件未造成人员伤亡或财产损失。

氢气报警器按设计运行,问题得以顺利解决。当主通风机改为连续运行（每天 24 小时,每周 7 天）后,运行恢复正常。此外,还增加了另一项安全预防措施,即在房间失去通风的情况下,通过压力开关向人员发出 远程警报（即：""砰"",""砰"",""砰""）。,

运行期间","The SS 24-inch pipe that failed was replaced with 1-1/4 Cr 1/2 Mo alloy pipe that is corrosion-resistant to SCC. A revised HTS bypass piping layout was installed to prevent the hazardous conditions that lead to the failure. A detailed hazard review and evaluation of all of the materials of construction in the hydrogen plant process gas system led to preventively changing several other pieces of piping and equipment items in the SMR process to 1-1/4 Cr 1/2 Mo.
发生故障的 24 英寸 SS 管道被替换为 1-1/4 Cr 1/2 Mo 合金管道,这种管道对 SCC 具有抗腐蚀作用。为防止出现导致故障的危险情况,还安装了经过修改的 HTS 旁路管道布局。对制氢厂工艺气体系统中的所有建筑材料进行详细的危险审查和评估后,将 SMR 工艺中的其他几个管道和设备项目改为 1-1/4 Cr 1/2 Mo。","A pipe rupture occurred in a steam methane reformer (SMR) process that produces hydrogen and export steam. The rupture occurred in a 24-inch diameter stainless steel (SS) pipe used to allow the process gas flow to bypass the high-temperature shift converter (HTS) during start-up. When the pipe ruptured, process gas contained in process equipment located upstream and downstream of the break vented into the SMR plant yard area. The vented process gas was a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam, and methane at 550 psig and 650 deg F. The escaping high-pressure gas caused an energy release and subsequent fire. The fire was confined within the SMR plant, but equipment located near the pipe failure was damaged. The SMR plant distributed control system (DCS) worked properly to automatically shut down the process, thereby limiting the amount of process gas that escaped. Emergency response services were provided on the scene by the local county fire department within minutes of the incident and the fire was extinguished within 10 minutes. There were no injuries and no releases of any acutely hazardous materials covered by the Risk Management Prevention Plan (RMPP), EPA CERCLA, and SARA Title III regulations.

Metallurgical examination of the failed pipe segment revealed cracking on the pipe interior. The cracks were the result of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of SS, caused by the presence of caustic (potassium hydroxide). The most likely source of the caustic was small amounts of potassium promoter normally present in the SMR catalyst. The section of the HTS bypass piping where the rupture occurred was normally cool and non-flowing. The piping layout allowed water and potassium hydroxide condensed from the process gas stream to collect in a low point. The SS material of construction of the bypass piping was susceptible to SCC from the concentrated caustic solution collecting in the bypass piping.
生产氢气和出口蒸汽的蒸汽甲烷转化器 (SMR) 过程中发生管道破裂。破裂发生在一根直径为 24 英寸的不锈钢 (SS) 管道上,该管道用于在启动过程中让工艺气流绕过高温变换转换器 (HTS)。管道破裂后,位于破裂处上游和下游的工艺设备中的工艺气体排放到了 SMR 工厂的堆场区域。泄漏的工艺气体是氢气,一氧化碳,二氧化碳,蒸汽和甲烷的混合物,压力为 550 psig,温度为 650 摄氏度。火灾被限制在 SMR 工厂内,但管道故障附近的设备受到损坏。SMR 工厂的分布式控制系统 (DCS) 正常工作,自动关闭了工艺流程,从而限制了工艺气体的泄漏量。当地县消防队在事发后几分钟内赶到现场提供应急服务,火势在 10 分钟内被扑灭。事故中没有人员伤亡,也没有发生风险管理预防计划 (RMPP),EPA CERCLA 和 SARA Title III 法规所涉及的任何急性有害物质泄漏。

对失效管段进行的冶金学检查发现,管道内部出现裂纹。这些裂纹是 SS 因腐蚀性物质（氢氧化钾）的存在而产生应力腐蚀开裂（SCC）的结果。苛性碱最有可能的来源是通常存在于 SMR 催化剂中的少量钾促进剂。发生破裂的那段 HTS 旁路管道通常是冷的,不流动。管道布局使得从工艺气流中冷凝下来的水和氢氧化钾聚集在一个低点。旁路管道的 SS 结构材料很容易受到旁路管道中聚集的高浓度苛性碱溶液的 SCC 影响。","None

The leak was identified by monitoring the stator water cooling system detraining tank. Following reactor shut down and generator rotor removal, a small hole was located in the collector end winding area of a slot on the top stator bar. A small particle of carbon steel (estimated to be 2 mm/0.078 inch by 0.6 mm/0.023 inch) is believed to have caused the damage. The source of the carbon steel particle was either foreign material introduced during previous generator internal work or from a phenomenon called ""back-of-core burning"", where electrical arcing caused the release of internal metal particles. See Attachment 1 for additional details.

The magnetized carbon steel particle vibrated with the changing magnetic field of the generator (60 Hz). This motion, along with the magnetic attraction of the stator bar, acted as a driver to bore through bar insulating tape and eventually into and through the surface of the hollow copper strand. The penetration of the generator strand caused the steep increase in monitored hydrogen in-leakage that necessitated the nuclear plant shutdown. This event did not affect nuclear safety.

Shutdown/outage activities to repair the hydrogen leakage in the stator cooling water system included identification and repair (plugging) of the damaged generator strand as well as thoroughly cleaning and magnetic sweeping of generator internals.
之前发现发电机氢气泄漏到定子冷却水系统中,泄漏量超过了预定的最大运行容许量,根据核电厂运行程序,核电厂从 100% 功率关闭。通过监测定子冷却水系统疏水箱发现了泄漏。反应堆关闭并拆除发电机转子后,在定子顶杆上一个槽的集电极末端绕组区域发现了一个小孔。据信,一个小的碳钢颗粒（估计为 2 毫米/0.078 英寸×0.6 毫米/0.023 英寸）造成了损坏。碳钢颗粒的来源可能是以前发电机内部工作时引入的外来材料,或者是一种称为 ""铁芯背面燃烧 ""的现象,电弧导致内部金属颗粒释放。更多详情请参见附录 1。

磁化的碳钢颗粒随着发电机磁场（60 赫兹）的变化而振动。这种运动,加上定子线棒的磁场吸引力,成为穿透线棒绝缘胶带的驱动力,并最终穿透空心铜绞线的表面。发电机绞线的穿透导致监测到的氢气渗漏急剧增加,从而导致核电厂必须关闭。这一事件并未影响核安全。为修复定子冷却水系统氢气泄漏而进行的停机/停运活动包括确定和修复（堵塞）受损的发电机绞线,以及彻底清洁发电机内部并进行磁力清扫。","None

Liquid hydrogen installations should be inspected by facility personnel on a frequent basis, consistent with NFPA 55, to verify proper operation and inspect for physical damage or leaks.

Industrial gas companies that design, install, and maintain liquid hydrogen installations should follow the guidelines set in the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) publications: G-5.4 - Standard for Hydrogen Piping Systems at Consumer Locations, G-5.5 - Hydrogen Vent Systems, H-3 - Cryogenic Hydrogen Storage, and H-5 - Installation Standards for Bulk Hydrogen Supply Systems.

应为当地应急人员提供氢气安全培训。设施人员应按照 NFPA 55 的规定经常检查液氢装置,以验证其是否正常运行,并检查是否有物理损坏或泄漏。如果出现问题,应立即联系维修公司。设计,安装和维护液氢装置的工业气体公司应遵守压缩气体协会 (CGA) 出版物中规定的准则： G-5. 4 - 消费场所氢气管道系统标准》,《G-5. 5 - 氢气排放系统》,《H-3 - 低温氢气储存》和《H-5 - 散装氢气供应系统安装标准》。爆破片对任何形式的背压都非常敏感。","A 9,000-gallon (34,069-liter) cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage vessel, installed outdoors at a manufacturing plant in an urban area, over-pressurized and released hydrogen into the atmosphere through a safety relief device (burst disk). When the burst disk released pressure, a loud bang was heard by neighbors and reported to the local police. The police investigated and heard the sound of gaseous hydrogen escaping from the vessel's vent stack, which rose approximately 15-20 feet (4.6-6.1 meters) in the air.

Police called the local fire department. Firefighters entered the facility and told employees inside that there was an explosion on the property and they needed to evacuate. As a precautionary measure, some nearby city buildings were also evacuated and the street was blocked off in front of the facility.

A facility representative went to the storage vessel to investigate. This individual saw that hydrogen was escaping from the vent stack, but there was no fire. The individual called the industrial gas company that services the installation to report the incident, and a field service technician was dispatched to the scene.

The technician arrived to find the tank pressure at zero and the burst disk blown. He switched the three-way diverter valve to the other safety relief device and replaced the burst disk when the line defrosted. After rebuilding the pressure, the field service technician leak-checked the lines and did not see any indication of fire at the stack ends.

Because the cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage vessel had experienced a long period of non-use, heating by the ambient air temperature (60°F/16°C) caused the vessel's internal temperature to rise even though it was vacuum-jacketed. The normal storage pressure for this vessel was 150 psi (10.3 bar). There were no injuries or damage from this incident, and inspectors from the manufacturing company and industrial gas company stated that the hydrogen safety venting equipment functioned properly. Normal operations resumed after it was determined that there were no unsafe conditions.

Approximately seven months later, the burst disk that had been replaced in the incident described above ruptured for the same reasons --- back pressure against the burst disk caused premature failure. No outside emergency response was involved with this second hydrogen venting incident, as once again the pressure relief system worked as designed. Following this incident, some modifications were made to the hydrogen piping to eliminate all back pressure on the burst disk.
一个 9,000 加仑（34,069 升）的低温液氢储存容器安装在市区一家制造厂的室外,由于超压,氢气通过安全泄压装置（爆破片）释放到大气中。当爆破片释放压力时,邻居听到一声巨响,并向当地警方报告。警方进行了调查,听到气态氢从容器的通风烟囱逸出的声音,烟囱升到约 15-20 英尺（4.6-6.1 米）高的空中。

警方呼叫了当地消防部门。消防员进入设施,告诉里面的员工这里发生了爆炸,他们需要撤离。作为预防措施,附近的一些城市建筑也被疏散,设施前的街道被封锁。

一名设施代表前往储存容器进行调查。此人看到氢气正从通风烟囱逸出,但没有着火。此人打电话给为该设施提供服务的工业气体公司报告了这一事件,一名现场服务技术人员被派往现场。

技术人员到达现场后发现储气罐压力为零,爆破片已被吹破。他将三通切换阀切换到另一个安全泄压装置,并在管道解冻后更换了爆破片。重建压力后,现场服务技术人员对管线进行了检漏,未发现烟囱末端有任何起火迹象。

由于低温液氢储存容器长期未使用,环境空气温度（60°F/16°C）的升温导致容器内部温度升高,尽管容器是真空密封的。该容器的正常储存压力为 150 磅/平方英寸（10.3 巴）。这次事故没有造成人员伤亡或财产损失,制造公司和工业气体公司的检查人员称,氢气安全排放设备运行正常。在确定不存在不安全状况后,生产恢复正常。

大约 7 个月后,在上述事件中更换过的爆破片因同样的原因破裂--爆破片承受的背压导致过早失效。由于泄压系统再次按照设计正常工作,因此在第二次氢气泄漏事件中没有采取外部应急措施。事故发生后,对氢气管道进行了一些修改,以消除爆破片上的所有背压。","None

运行期间","The possible outcomes from new maintenance scenarios can be predicted by using an accurate simulation. The proposed filter change-out maintenance was studied to identify conditions to which the catalyst might be exposed and a mock-up of the filter, it's mounting/housing, and catalyst was assembled. Conditions selected to represent the worst case that could be encountered during a maintenance operation were reproduced. For the conditions of temperature and pressure, this included simulating the state of the catalyst. Oxygen was removed from the catalyst with a dry nitrogen purge, and followed by a graduated hydrogen purge from 0.5 to 10 % concentration. Hydrogenation was completed by then subjecting the catalyst to a purge of 100 % concentration of hydrogen. De-ionized water was vacuum-degassed for 10 minutes to remove oxygen, then saturated with hydrogen (by bubbling) at pressure. The simulation of pre-change-out filter conditions was completed by adding the hydrogen-saturated water to the hydrogenated catalyst within the mock-up system. The simulation of conditions introduced by the proposed maintenance was accomplished by draining the water and introducing a purge of oxygen-enriched air (ISS ambient conditions). The drained water and purged air were captured for laboratory analysis to check for thermal degradation and toxic byproducts of Teflon. Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectral detection (GC-MS) revealed no fluorinated species above the detection limits in the gas phase, and Ion Chromatography (IC) identified only small amounts of fluorinated compounds in the liquid phase (not indicative of a handling hazard). Post-test thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of samples indicated that insufficient heat was generated in the tests to thermally decompose the Teflonized catalyst. The conclusion is that when charged catalyst is handled wet, reactions with air are reduced to the point of permitting safe handling. A caution is noted. While deliberate simulation of conditions that would result in rapid exposure to dry charged catalyst was not performed, the hydrogenation step, if not initially done gradually, but with 100 % concentration hydrogen, will produce smoke and steam, suggesting any procedure that introduces rapid exposure to air could result in high temperatures and potentially hazardous by-products.Maintenance on PEM technology systems that involves accumulated catalyst within filters may be safely performed by reducing the rate of exposure of catalyst materials to air or oxygen, always keeping a coating of water on catalyst surfaces and making sure discarded catalyst is properly disposed and not allowed to dry out, especially in the presence of volatile and flammable materials. Catalyst materials exposed for a time in a hydrogen environment will absorb substantial amounts of hydrogen, becoming ""activated"". Subsequent exposure to air or oxygen without mitigating steps can cause high temperatures to occur on catalyst surfaces, creating a potential fire hazard. Do not expose Teflon to high temperatures.
通过精确模拟,可以预测新维护方案可能产生的结果。对拟议的过滤器更换维护进行了研究,以确定催化剂可能暴露的条件,并组装了过滤器,其安装/外壳和催化剂的模型。所选择的条件代表了维护操作过程中可能遇到的最坏情况。对于温度和压力条件,包括模拟催化剂的状态。先用干氮吹扫除去催化剂中的氧气,再用浓度为 0.5%至 10%的氢气吹扫。然后将催化剂置于浓度为 100% 的氢气吹扫中以完成氢化。将去离子水真空脱气 10 分钟以去除氧气,然后在压力下用氢气（通过气泡）达到饱和。将氢饱和水加入到模拟系统中的氢化催化剂中,就完成了更换过滤器前条件的模拟。通过排空水和引入富氧空气（ISS 环境条件）来模拟拟议维护所引入的条件。排出的水和净化的空气被收集起来进行实验室分析,以检查聚四氟乙烯的热降解和有毒副产品。质谱检测气相色谱法（GC-MS）显示气相中没有超过检测限的含氟物质,离子色谱法（IC）仅在液相中发现少量含氟化合物（不表明存在处理危险）。试验后对样品进行的热重分析 (TGA) 表明,试验中产生的热量不足以对聚四氟乙烯催化剂进行热分解。结论是,在湿处理带电催化剂的情况下,与空气的反应会降低到可以安全处理的程度。需要注意的是。虽然没有刻意模拟快速接触干带电催化剂的条件,但氢化步骤如果最初不是逐步进行,而是使用 100% 浓度的氢气,就会产生烟雾和蒸汽,这表明任何引入快速接触空气的程序都可能导致高温和潜在的危险副产品。对涉及过滤器内积聚催化剂的 PEM 技术系统进行维护时,可通过降低催化剂材料与空气或氧气的接触速度,始终在催化剂表面保持一层水,确保废弃催化剂得到妥善处理且不允许其变干（尤其是在存在挥发性和易燃材料的情况下）等方法来确保安全。在氢气环境中暴露一段时间的催化剂材料会吸收大量氢气,从而被 ""活化""。如果随后不采取缓解措施而暴露在空气或氧气中,会导致催化剂表面产生高温,从而造成潜在的火灾危险。请勿将聚四氟乙烯暴露在高温下。","Within the International Space Station (ISS) oxygen generator, an increase in differential pressure across a pump supplying return water to a PEM electrolyzer fuel cell stack had persisted over a 4-month period and was approaching the shut-off limit for the system. This decrease in performance was suspected to be caused by water-borne catalyst fines containing platinum black and Teflon®* binder materials, shed by the fuel cell stack, and accumulated within the pump's inlet filter. Maintenance in the field was required.

The system had been designed for factory maintenance, and no contingency had been planned to handle field maintenance for such a circumstance. An initial assessment of hazards for the proposed filter maintenance raised the concern that opening the water line would release hydrogen gas from pressurized water, and with the sudden exposure of the debris collected on the filter to oxygen from outside, put both fluids in contact with the catalyst fines on the filter. Dry catalyst is known to heat to temperatures over 800 °C when exposed to hydrogen and oxygen. This could pose a fire hazard to personnel and surroundings. In addition, exposure of the Teflon binder to high temperatures can produce micron-scale Teflon particles, hydrogen fluoride (HF), and carbonyl fluoride (COF2) that pose an acute toxic inhalation hazard. However, water in the system will mitigate heat generation by a combination of heat sinking and physically limiting the availability of oxygen to approach the catalyst quickly. The factors that would prevail were not known. No action could be taken until these potential hazards were better understood.

在国际空间站（ISS）制氧机内,向 PEM 电解槽燃料电池堆供应回水的泵上的压差持续增加了 4 个月,已接近系统的关闭极限。性能下降的原因被怀疑是燃料电池堆脱落的含有铂黑和 Teflon®* 粘合剂材料的水载催化剂粉末在泵的入口过滤器内积聚所致。需要进行现场维护。

该系统是为工厂维护而设计的,没有计划在这种情况下进行现场维护的应急措施。对拟议过滤器维护的危险性进行初步评估后发现,打开水管会从加压水中释放出氢气,而过滤器上收集的碎屑会突然接触到外部的氧气,从而使两种流体都接触到过滤器上的催化剂碎片。众所周知,干催化剂在氢气和氧气的作用下会加热到 800 °C 以上。这可能会对人员和周围环境造成火灾危险。此外,聚四氟乙烯粘合剂暴露在高温下会产生微米级聚四氟乙烯颗粒,氟化氢 (HF) 和羰基氟化物 (COF2),造成急性吸入中毒危险。不过,系统中的水可以通过热沉降和物理限制氧气快速接近催化剂来缓解热量产生。目前尚不清楚这些因素。在更好地了解这些潜在危害之前,不能采取任何行动。

运行期间","Metallurgical examination of the two failed disks by light optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopic analysis (EDS) found them to be fabricated from pure nickel with evidence of extensive fracture. Each of the 24 tubes in the system is protected by a burst disk. Examination of another disk in the system that had not given way found that it, too, possessed surface fracture features, and they extended around the entire periphery of the rupture disk. Such defects are indicative of hydrogen embrittlement. An inspection of all vent circuits found that each of the 24 disks in service was made from nickel. Nickel is a material not recommended for hydrogen service in rupture disks.Prior to the attempted use of the tube bank for hydrogen service, the vessel had been employed for helium service. The pressure vessel documentation accompanying the system indicated that the burst disks were made of stainless steel and rated to 10,000 psig. Careful physical inspection of system hardware is recommended on any system being adapted to hydrogen service. In this instance, inspection conducted prior to the transfer in service could have alerted operators to the need to install disks with the proper material, and therefore, have prevented the incident.Relief of hydrogen gas should not lead to movement of the vent line sufficient to cause system damage. Corrective actions included increasing the line diameter and adding bracing between the lines and the system bulkhead to strengthen the components should other releases occur. The hardware that failed was of a commercial origin. Caution should be exercised to insure that all hardware is adequate for its designed purpose, even when procured from a commercial source.More information on management of change can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner and also in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual. A web-based resource developed by Sandia National Laboratories to provide data on hydrogen embrittlement of various materials is available at Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials.
通过光学显微镜 (LOM),扫描电子显微镜 (SEM) 和能量色散 X 射线光谱分析 (EDS) 对两个失效磁盘进行的冶金学检查发现,它们是用纯镍制造的,有大面积断裂的迹象。系统中的 24 个管道均由一个爆破片保护。在对系统中另一个未塌陷的圆盘进行检查时发现,它的表面也有断裂特征,而且这些断裂特征延伸到整个破裂圆盘的外围。这种缺陷表明存在氢脆现象。对所有通气回路进行检查后发现,24 个使用中的爆破片均由镍制成。镍是一种不建议用于爆破片氢气工况的材料。在尝试将管组用于氢气服务之前,该容器曾用于氦气服务。系统附带的压力容器文件显示,爆破片由不锈钢制成,额定压力为 10,000 psig。建议对任何适用于氢气服务的系统硬件进行仔细的物理检查。在这种情况下,在转入服务之前进行检查本可以提醒操作人员需要安装使用适当材料的防爆盘,从而防止事故的发生。释放氢气不应导致通风管道移动到足以造成系统损坏的程度。纠正措施包括增加管路直径,并在管路和系统隔板之间增加支撑,以在发生其他释放时加固部件。发生故障的硬件是商用的。即使是从商业渠道采购的硬件,也应谨慎行事,确保所有硬件都能满足其设计用途。有关变更管理的更多信息,请参阅 ""经验教训 ""角和《氢安全最佳实践手册》。桑迪亚国家实验室开发了一个网络资源,提供各种材料的氢脆数据,请访问材料氢兼容性技术参考。","An operation to increase the pressure within a hydrogen tube-trailer to 6000 psig was in progress when a burst disk failed at approximately 5200 psig and hydrogen was released. A vent line attached to the burst disk was not sufficiently anchored and bent outward violently from the thrust of the release over an approximate 4-inch moment arm, causing considerable damage to the adjacent vent system components. The operation is conducted with personnel present, but fortunately no one was in proximity when the burst disk failed.

Following the incident, the damaged portion of the tube bank, consisting of 6 tubes, was isolated by valves on the system manifold. The operation was resumed with the unaffected portion of the tube bank, possessing another 18 tubes, until a second burst disk failed.

Following positive testing, the system was restarted and pressurized without any further malfunctioning.	The hydrogen discharge pipe was extended from the low roof of the compressor building (2.5 m) to the higher roof of a neighboring building (6 m). With this modification, any potential hydrogen ignition would occur at approximately 6 meters from ground, farther from personnel than the 2.5 meters of the previous situation.	The compressor was sent to the manufacturer for preventive maintenance in order to lower the frequency of component malfunctioning.	Plans for regular maintenance of the non-return valve will be recorded in the next revision of the Design and Safety Report.	A flame arrestor was purchased and mounted at the end of the exhaust pipe on top of the building.
已采取以下纠正措施：对止回阀进行了拆卸,清洗和测试。测试结果良好,系统重新启动并加压,未再发生任何故障。氢气排放管道从压缩机厂房的低屋顶（2.5 米）延伸至邻近厂房的高屋顶（6 米）。通过这一改动,任何潜在的氢气点火都将发生在距离地面约 6 米的地方,比之前的 2.5 米距离人员更远。压缩机被送往制造商处进行预防性维护,以降低部件故障频率。定期维护止回阀的计划将记录在下一次修订的《设计与安全报告》中。购买了一个阻火器,安装在大楼顶部排气管的末端。","The malfunctioning of the non-return valve of the hydrogen compressor caused the pressure between the hydrogen bottle and the compressor to rise up to the maximum allowed pressure of 275 barg. As a consequence, as foreseen by the safety system, the rupture disk of the safety valve broke and the hydrogen content of the gas bottle and the pipe section involved was released on top of the building. The flame was seen for a very short period by a guard, and could have been caused by the following series of events:

	Expansion of hydrogen at the end of the exhaust pipe.
	Consequent mixing of hydrogen and air up to a near-stoichiometric mixture and increase of gas temperature.
	Mixture ignition due to sparks from static electricity generated by gas molecule friction against suspended dust particles. The safety system properly reacted to a malfunctioning component of the gas distribution system and avoided any risk to personnel or property.

运行期间","Specific response drills/exercises need to be conducted yearly. In this case, all safety systems worked as they should and outside emergency responders were not needed.	Performing other tasks while filling hydrogen tube trailers, such as mechanic work, should be avoided. Most premature failures of hydrogen tube trailer PRD burst discs occur during the fill process.	Grounding, as was done in the incident, should always be done during hydrogen filling. However, even when the fill vessel is grounded, it is not unusual for a hydrogen release to immediately ignite.	The facility safety deluge water system should be checked periodically for coverage. In this case, a water cannon was a little off target from the last time it was operated and has now be repositioned and stabilized to ensure that it does not move in the future.	Emergency responders assumed that adjacent tube trailers were heating up from single-cylinder vent flare as a 300°F (149°C) reading was obtained with a thermal device. This slightly delayed the closing of the cylinder isolation valves on the tube trailer. After-incident investigation found no paint discolored or burnt, so the temperature taken by the emergency responders was likely near the flaming vent discharge point.	Securing hydrogen fill valve(s) at the back of the tube trailer was not dependent on the temperature at the vent stack, as this area was covered by deluge nozzles and located 40 feet (12.2 meters) away from the vent stack.	Media involvement and resulting speculation can portray a situation as being much worse than it actually is.
需要每年进行具体的应对演习/演练。在此案例中,所有安全系统都发挥了应有的作用,不需要外部应急响应人员。应避免在氢气管拖车充气时执行其他任务,如机械作业。氢气管拖车压力释放装置 (PRD) 爆破片的大多数过早故障都发生在填充过程中。在氢气填充过程中,应始终按照事故中的做法进行接地。然而,即使填充容器接地,氢气释放立即点燃的情况也很常见。应定期检查设施安全排水系统的覆盖范围。在本案例中,水炮与上次操作时的目标有些偏离,现在已经重新定位并稳固,以确保今后不会移动。应急响应人员假定相邻的管拖车正在从单缸通风口的火炬中升温,因为用热敏装置获得了 300°F （149°C）的读数。这稍微延迟了管拖车上气缸隔离阀的关闭。事故后调查发现,油漆没有变色或烧焦,因此应急人员测得的温度很可能接近燃烧的排气口排放点。确保管道拖车后部的氢气填充阀的安全并不取决于通风管道的温度,因为该区域已被脱水喷嘴覆盖,且距离通风管道有 40 英尺（12.2 米）远。媒体的介入和由此产生的猜测可能会使情况比实际严重得多。","Near the end of the process of filling a gaseous hydrogen tube trailer at a liquid hydrogen transfilling station, a safety pressure-relief device (PRD) rupture disc on one of the tube trailer’s ten tubes burst and vented hydrogen gas. The PRD vent tube directed gas to the top of the trailer where the hydrogen vented and ignited, blowing a flame straight up in the air. The operator filling the tube trailer heard a loud explosion from the sudden release of hydrogen gas and saw flames immediately. The operator closed the main fill valve on the tube trailer, stopping the hydrogen fill; however, the ten cylinders on the tube trailer were almost full (2500 psig/173 bar). The tube trailer involved in this incident was one of two tube trailers being filled simultaneously and was second in a line up of five tube trailers parked adjacent to one another at this location. The ten PRDs on the tube trailer (one for each hydrogen tube) are located at the front of the trailer (king pin end) and each PRD has a vent pipe to direct vented hydrogen to a safe location on top of the tube trailer (see Figures 1 – 5).

Emergency responders were dispatched to the scene. The facility deluge system was turned on. This system covers the trailer fill aisle with water and includes nozzles at the rear of the trailer and a fire cannon directed to the front. When the emergency responders arrived, they immediately began spraying the adjacent trailers to ensure that they stayed cool. The HazMat crews closed the 10 individual tube fill isolation valves located at the rear of the tube trailer and extinguished the fire. Total time to control the incident was less than 10 minutes and there was no property damage from this event. Minor first aid was required for a mechanic working under the tube trailer during the filling process who bumped into the trailer several times during a hurried exit when the loud noise was heard.

The safety systems on the tube trailer worked as designed. The hydrogen tube trailer involved in this incident was doing its first fill after requalification, where all the PRDs had just been replaced. The PRD rupture disc designed for 3500 psig (241 bar) failed at about 1000 psig (69 bar) below rated pressure. The hydrogen tube trailer was grounded per procedure during the filling operation. Subsequent follow-up examination of the PDR rupture disc lot by the PDR manufacturer found that all of the lot conformed to specification.
在液氢加注站对气态氢管拖车进行加注的过程即将结束时,拖车十根管子中的一根管子上的安全泄压装置 (PRD) 爆破片爆裂,氢气喷出。泄压装置（PRD）排气管将气体引向拖车顶部,氢气在那里喷出并点燃,火焰直冲云霄。给拖车充气的操作员听到了氢气突然释放产生的巨大爆炸声,并立即看到了火焰。操作员关闭了拖车上的主加注阀,停止了氢气加注；然而,拖车上的十个气瓶几乎都已加满（2500 psig/173 bar）。发生事故的氢气管拖车是同时进行充气的两辆氢气管拖车中的一辆,也是该地点相邻停放的五辆氢气管拖车中的第二辆。氢气管拖车上的十个泄压装置（每个氢气管一个）位于拖车的前部（King pin 端）,每个泄压装置 (PRD) 都有一个通风管,用于将排出的氢气引到氢气管拖车顶部的安全位置（见图 1 - 5）。

紧急救援人员被派往现场。开启了设施排水系统。该系统用水覆盖拖车的填充通道,包括拖车后部的喷嘴和前部的消防炮。紧急救援人员到达后,立即开始向邻近的拖车喷水,以确保它们保持凉爽。危险品处理人员关闭了位于管式拖车后部的 10 个单独的管式灌装隔离阀,并扑灭了大火。控制事故的总时间不到 10 分钟,没有造成任何财产损失。在灌注过程中,一名机械师在管拖车下工作,听到巨响后匆忙离开时几次撞到拖车,需要进行轻微急救。

氢气管拖车上的安全系统均按设计运行。此次事故中涉及的氢气管拖车是在重新认证后进行的首次充气,当时刚刚更换了所有的减压阀。设计压力为 3500 psig（241 bar）的泄压装置（PRD）爆破片在低于额定压力约 1000 psig（69 bar）时发生故障。氢气管拖车在充气过程中按程序接地。随后,PDR 制造商对该批次的 PDR 爆破片进行了后续检查,发现所有批次的 PDR 爆破片均符合规格要求。","None

检查期间","1. Evaluate any change in normal procedures or conditions for storage of aluminum hydride products. In this case, the aluminum hydride material was typically stored at -35°C in the glove box freezer. However, due to a change in glove boxes, this was no longer an option. Since commercially available aluminum hydride compound is shipped in glass bottles at room temperature, it was assumed that this was considered safe handling. The vial was stable for 6 weeks before the near miss occurred.2. Limit aluminum hydride materials to small quantities as needed for immediate use. Larger samples have the potential to caused more damage.3. Do not store aluminum hydride materials for extended periods of time and promptly dispose of any remaining material after use.4. In-process aluminum hydride material should be stored at lower temperatures (i.e., in a freezer) and in an air-free contained environment (i.e., inside an air-free glove box) to reduce or slow decomposition into volatile materials (e.g., hydrogen, aluminum metal, and similar). In this case, if the aluminum hydride material had been stored in air, it is likely that a fire may have started.5. Store aluminum hydride material in plastic containers instead of sealed glass containers to avoid catastrophic failure of containment. In this case, it is likely that the decomposition process of the aluminum hydride compound slowly built up pressure sufficient to destroy the glass vial.Additional discussion about working with reactive metal-hydride materials in the laboratory can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website and in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
1. 评估氢化铝产品正常储存程序或条件的任何变化。在此案例中,氢化铝材料通常储存在零下 35 摄氏度的手套箱冰柜中。然而,由于手套箱的改变,这不再是一种选择。由于市面上的氢化铝化合物是在室温下用玻璃瓶装运的,因此可以认为这样的处理方式是安全的。在险情发生前,小瓶已稳定存放 6 周。2. 氢化铝材料仅限于即时使用所需的少量样品。较大的样品有可能造成更大的损坏。3. 3. 不要长时间储存氢化铝材料,使用后要及时处理剩余材料。4. 4. 加工中的氢化铝材料应储存在较低的温度下（如冷冻室）和无空气的封闭环境中 （如无空气的手套箱内）,以减少或减缓分解成挥发性物质（如氢气,金属铝和 类似物质）。在这种情况下,如果氢化铝材料存放在空气中,很可能会引发火灾。5. 5. 将氢化铝材料存放在塑料容器中,而不是密封的玻璃容器中,以避免密封失效。在这种情况下,氢化铝化合物的分解过程很可能会慢慢产生足以破坏玻璃瓶的压力。有关在实验室使用活性金属氢化物材料的更多讨论,请参阅本网站的 ""经验教训 ""角和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A closed 20-mL glass scintillation vial containing approximately 5 grams of an aluminum hydride compound ruptured and shattered, likely due to pressure buildup after 6 weeks of storage.

运行期间","Mechanical pressure gauges tend to be imprecise if only used in a narrow portion of the full scale. Digital transducers, although slightly more expensive, offer much more precision. The event happened because the set pressure was only 10% of full scale, and the error of the mechanical gauge was over 5%.While this is not the reason for the event described, control of the charging pressure is one of the most crucial parameters. Although the storage is at low pressure, the pressure increase upon temperature increase can be much steeper than the ideal gas law would predict, depending on the charging conditions.The chosen trigger point of 35 bar for the pressure relief valve is very low. Based on the tank design, at least 60 bar would be acceptable.Additional discussion about working with reactive metal-hydride materials in the laboratory can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website and in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
如果只使用全量程的一小部分,机械压力表往往不够精确。数字传感器虽然价格稍高,但精度更高。事件发生的原因是设定压力仅为满量程的 10%,而机械压力表的误差超过了 5%。虽然这不是发生上述事件的原因,但控制充注压力是最关键的参数之一。虽然储存的压力很低,但根据充注条件,温度升高时的压力增加可能比理想气体定律预测的要陡峭得多。泄压阀所选的 35 巴触发点非常低。根据储气罐的设计,至少 60 巴的压力是可以接受的。有关在实验室中使用活性金属氢化物材料的更多讨论,请参阅本网站的 ""经验总结 ""和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A metal hydride storage system was refilled using compressed hydrogen in a closed lab environment. The tank system is an in-house development and is optimized for high hydrogen storage density and use with an air-cooled fuel cell. The system is equipped with a pressure relief valve that opens gradually at 35 bar to protect the tank from overpressure conditions. The tank itself is designed to adsorb 400 g of hydrogen at a pressure less than 15 bar.

For refueling, the secondary pressure on the compressed hydrogen supply container was set to 20 bar and the adsorption of the hydride was started without hydrogen flow limitation. Due to the exothermic nature of the hydride upon recharge, as expected a sharp increase in tank temperature was measured. The tank was uncooled because the temperature increase leads to an increase in plateau pressure, which automatically reduces hydrogen uptake.

After 3 min 30 sec, the overpressure device was triggered and hydrogen was released into the lab. The hydrogen supply from the compressed gas cylinder was cut immediately and the window was opened. The operator was on site at the time of the incident. The amount of hydrogen released is hard to quantify, but we estimate something in the range of 200-1,000 normal liters. The overpressure device closed after some minutes.

Analysis of the incident, which should theoretically not have happened, revealed the following. The used pressure reducer was made for 200 bar input pressure and 0-200 bar output pressure. The pressure gauge on the secondary stage was imprecise at the intended charging pressure of 20 bar. Checking with an electronic pressure gauge revealed a pressure of roughly 32 bar. Upon charging, the so-called ""Supply Pressure Effect"" (e.g., increase of secondary pressure with reduced primary pressure) of the pressure reducer led to an increased secondary pressure, which exceeded the limit of the pressure relief device. Also, some influence on the pressure due to the increased temperature cannot be ruled out, although that would be related to hydrogen in the gas phase rather than in the hydride.

As corrective steps, the charging pressure was measured with a digital pressure transducer instead of a mechanical gauge. The charging pressure was limited to 15 bar to slow down the charging.
在封闭的实验室环境中使用压缩氢为金属氢化物存储系统充气。该储氢罐系统是内部开发的,针对高储氢密度和与空气冷却燃料电池一起使用进行了优化。该系统配备了一个泄压阀,当压力达到 35 巴时,泄压阀会逐渐打开,以防止氢气罐超压。储氢罐本身可在低于 15 巴的压力下吸附 400 克氢。

为了再加氢,压缩氢供应容器的二次压力被设定为 20 巴,氢化物的吸附在没有氢气流量限制的情况下开始。由于氢化物在充电时会放热,因此测量到氢气罐温度急剧上升。储氢罐没有冷却,因为温度升高会导致高原压力增加,从而自动减少氢气吸收。

3 分 30 秒后,超压装置被触发,氢气被释放到实验室中。压缩气瓶的氢气供应立即被切断,窗户被打开。事故发生时,操作员正在现场。释放的氢气量很难量化,但我们估计在 200-1,000 正常升之间。几分钟后,超压装置关闭。对这起理论上不应该发生的事件进行分析后发现了以下情况。使用的减压器输入压力为 200 巴,输出压力为 0-200 巴。二级减压器上的压力表在 20 巴的预定充气压力下不精确。用电子压力表检查发现,压力大约为 32 巴。充气时,减压器的所谓 ""供应压力效应""（例如,二级压力增加而一级压力降低）导致二级压力增加,超过了泄压装置的极限。此外,也不能排除温度升高对压力的影响,尽管这与气相中的氢有关,而不是氢化物中的氢。

作为纠正措施,用数字压力传感器代替机械压力表测量充注压力。充电压力被限制在 15 巴,以减缓充电速度。","None

Install an oxygen analyzer with an alarm as close to the compressor suction inlet as possible.	Attach all cylinders to the filling rack, discharge the contents to the atmosphere, and evacuate before filling.	Analyze as soon as possible the contents of at least one cylinder of each rack of cylinders charged.	Eliminate the recycle connection from the suction side of the compressor to the blowdown pot.	When compressing hydrogen, disconnect all interconnecting lines from the hydrogen suction line except the inert gas line.	Establish more definite procedures and responsibilities for maintenance repairs, construction, and operations.
调查委员会概述了几项建议,以指导合成液体燃料实验室氢气压缩机的未来运行：安装一个切断装置,当吸气压力下降到一到两英寸水的正压时关闭压缩机。在尽可能靠近压缩机吸入口的地方安装带警报器的氧气分析仪。将所有气瓶安装到充气架上,将内装物排入大气,并在充气前排空。尽快分析每个充气钢瓶架上至少一个钢瓶的内容物。取消从压缩机吸气侧到排污罐的循环连接。压缩氢气时,除惰性气体管路外,断开氢气吸入管路上的所有连接管路。为维护修理,施工和操作制定更明确的程序和责任。","Forty-six hydrogen cylinders were accidentally charged with air instead of additional hydrogen during recharging operations at a synthetic liquid fuels laboratory. Cylinders were manifolded in batches of 10 or 12 to the utility compressor outside the laboratory. In normal operations, partly used cylinders containing hydrogen at a pressure of 800-900 psi were recharged to a pressure of 2000-2100 psi. Since the contaminated cylinders contained a highly explosive mixture of about 40% hydrogen and 60% air, it was decided to release the compressed gas to the atmosphere outside the building after grounding the cylinders. Two of the cylinders were successfully discharged, but an explosion occurred while the third cylinder was being discharged. Two chemical engineers were killed by the blast, an operator was injured and required hospitalization, and the laboratory building and equipment were damaged.

The investigating committee postulated that 1) there may have been oil present in the regulator that ignited at a relatively low temperature and then ignited the hydrogen-air mixture, or 2) there may have been a metallic compound present that catalyzed the oxidation and subsequent ignition of the hydrogen-air mixture. Other possible causes that were considered less likely were 1) the existence of a leak around the attachment of the regulator to the cylinder, with ignition of the leaking gas by friction or static spark, and 2) ignition of the cylinder contents as a result of the electrical potential of a fire alarm post against which the cylinder was leaning while being discharged.

The probable cause for the contamination of the hydrogen cylinders was that the 3-inch gate valve on the hydrogen intake line to the compressor was closed during the filling operation. It was not possible to determine with certainty how the air entered the system due to conflicting testimony of laboratory employees. However, it likely entered through one or more of the many valves on the compressor suction system, any one of which may have been inadvertently left open.
在一个合成液体燃料实验室的充气操作过程中,46 个氢气瓶意外充入了空气,而不是额外的氢气。气瓶以 10 或 12 个为一批,分流到实验室外的公用压缩机。在正常操作中,部分使用过的氢气瓶的压力为 800-900 psi,充气后的压力为 2000-2100 psi。由于受污染的气瓶中含有约 40% 氢气和 60% 空气的高爆炸性混合物,因此决定在将气瓶接地后将压缩气体释放到大楼外的大气中。其中两个气瓶被成功释放,但在释放第三个气瓶时发生了爆炸。两名化学工程师在爆炸中丧生,一名操作员受伤,需要住院治疗,实验室建筑和设备受损。

调查委员会推测：1）调节器中可能存在油,在相对较低的温度下点燃,然后引燃氢气-空气混合物；或 2）可能存在金属化合物,催化氧化,然后引燃氢气-空气混合物。其他被认为可能性较小的原因有：1）调节器与气瓶的连接处存在泄漏,泄漏的气体在摩擦或静电火花的作用下被点燃；2）气瓶在放气时,由于气瓶靠在火警报警柱上,火警报警柱的电位导致气瓶内的气体被点燃。

造成氢气瓶污染的可能原因是,在充气操作过程中,压缩机氢气吸入管道上的 3 英寸闸阀被关闭。由于实验室员工的证词相互矛盾,无法确定空气是如何进入系统的。不过,空气很可能是通过压缩机吸气系统上的一个或多个阀门进入的,其中任何一个阀门都可能无意中被打开。","Heat generated by the adiabatic compression of gas in the regulator of an air-contaminated hydrogen cylinder as the cylinder valve was opened

The hydrogen release system contains a number of air-actuated ball valves which are sequenced by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in order to obtain the desired release parameters. During an experimental release sequence, a PLC valve command failed to open the valve even though the PLC valve position confirm signal indicated the valve had opened. On further investigation, the valve actuator and valve stem were found to be moving correctly, but the valve was not opening. The system was depressurized and purged with nitrogen, and the valve was removed for inspection. Inspection required dismantling the valve, and in both incidents a sheared valve stem was found. The valve stem failures occurred after 8 to 14 months of continuous hydrogen operation at pressures of 800 to 850 bar (11,603 to 12,328 psi). The two failed hydrogen valves were identical and rated by the valve manufacturer for hydrogen service.

The cause of this incident has not been determined, but valve stem material incompatibility with hydrogen (causing a material weakening) is suspected, although it could also have been a design flaw. Review of the valve manufacturer's drawings showed the valve stem material to be 17-4 precipitation hardening stainless steel that has been reported in the literature (Attachment 1) as having a 90% reduction in fracture toughness in a hydrogen environment. No metallurgical analysis was done on the failed valve stems to confirm a material failure. The valves were repaired with new valve stems made from 316 stainless steel, placed back in service, and have operated satisfactorily for 18 months without failure.

这起事故的原因尚未确定,但怀疑阀杆材料与氢气不相容（导致材料减弱）,尽管也可能是设计缺陷。对阀门制造商图纸的审查显示,阀杆材料为 17-4 沉淀硬化不锈钢,文献（附录 1）报道称这种材料在氢环境中的断裂韧性降低了 90%。没有对故障阀杆进行冶金分析以确认材料故障。用 316 不锈钢制成的新阀杆对阀门进行了修复,并重新投入使用,18 个月的运行情况令人满意,未出现故障。","None

运行期间","Inadequate Safeguards - The system was designed with low-point drains to facilitate water removal, however, these were found to be inadequate in both location and size. The fact that the mixed feed pre-heat coil was not self-draining was unknown prior to the incident. After a thorough review of the entire reformer furnace feed system was completed, existing drains were increased in size and others added to ensure that the entire feed system could be drained.	Inadequate Procedure - The startup procedure did not account for a startup of a cold furnace with no hold points for catalyst reduction or refractory dry out. As a result, the time to reach the critical ""steam in"" temperature of 350°C (662°F) was short as compared to previous startups. Also, the procedure provides little direction for confirming that the reformer furnace feed system is dry. Modifications to the procedure were completed that included a longer heat-up period, the addition of more detailed guidance for verifying that the feed system is dry, and a formal sign-off by both operations and engineering personnel. Also, a separate cold-eyes review by external experts was completed as part of the pre-startup safety review.	Lack of Change Management - a. The startup procedure had two hold points for refractory dry out and new catalyst reduction during the heat-up phase prior to introducing the 4.1 mPa (600 psig) startup steam. These hold points were not utilized, since it appeared that neither was required. Consequently, the heat-up cycle was artificially shortened. It became apparent that this alteration to the startup sequence was not viewed as a change by operations. Several sections of the procedure were not performed, since they did not apply to this startup. b. Shutdown and startup procedures are designed to take a unit from safe operation to a zero energy state and then return it to safe operation. Changing these sequences by an intentional omission is a change and must be properly assessed for risk. The decision to leave some steam flow in the steam-generating system for this winter shutdown was made to keep the system warm and prevent freezing. However, no formal risk assessment was performed and no management of change (MOC) was generated. A risk assessment was performed prior to the startup, but the change in status of the steam system was not evaluated. In fact, the decision to leave steam in was seen as a safeguard from the risk of freezing. This provided an opportunity for water to accumulate upstream of the reformer furnace.	Non-essential Personnel - At the time of the incident, there were seven people on the furnace structure. Only the operations personnel were essential. Changes have been made to ensure that non-essential personnel are cleared from the area during startup activities.More information on management of change can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner and also in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
保障措施不足 - 系统设计有低点排水沟,以方便排水,但发现这些排水沟的位置和大小都不合适。在事故发生之前,人们并不知道混合进料预热盘管没有自排水功能。在对整个转化炉进料系统进行彻底检查后,增加了现有排水口的尺寸,并增设了其他排水口,以确保整个进料系统能够排水。程序不当 - 启动程序没有考虑到冷炉启动时没有催化剂还原或耐火材料干燥的保持点。因此,与以前的启动相比,达到 350°C (662°F) 临界 ""蒸汽进入 ""温度的时间较短。此外,该程序几乎没有提供确认转化炉进料系统是否干燥的指导。已完成的程序修改包括延长加热时间,增加更详细的进料系统干燥确认指导,以及操作和工程人员的正式签字确认。此外,作为启动前安全审查的一部分,还完成了由外部专家进行的单独冷眼审查。缺乏变更管理 - a. 在引入 4.A.之前的加热阶段,启动程序有耐火材料干燥和新催化剂还原两个暂停点。1 mPa（600 psig）启动蒸汽。这些保持点没有被使用,因为似乎两者都不需要。因此,加热周期被人为地缩短了。显然,操作人员并没有将启动顺序的这一改变视为改变。b. 停机和开机程序的目的是使设备从安全运行状态进入零能耗状态,然后再恢复到安全运行状态。由于故意疏忽而改变这些程序是一种改变,必须对风险进行适当的评估。此次冬季停机决定在蒸汽发生系统中保留一定的蒸汽流量,是为了保持系统温暖,防止冻结。但是,没有进行正式的风险评估,也没有生成变更管理（MOC）。在启动前进行了风险评估,但没有对蒸汽系统的状态变化进行评估。事实上,让蒸汽系统继续运行的决定被认为是一种防范冻结风险的措施。这就为转化炉上游的积水提供了机会。非必要人员 - 事故发生时,炉子结构上共有 7 人。只有操作人员是必要的。为确保在启动活动期间将非必要人员清出该区域,已经做出了改变。有关变更管理的更多信息,请参阅 ""经验总结 ""和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A hydrogen reformer furnace at a refinery was shutdown for maintenance to remove and cap the inlet and outlet headers of some radiant tubes that had previously developed hot spots and been isolated by externally pinching them off at the inlet. A decision was made to leave steam in the steam-generating circuit during this maintenance operation to prevent freezing. After maintenance was complete, the startup procedure required the furnace to be first heated up to 350°C (662°F) prior to introducing 4136 kPa (600 psig) steam into the radiant tubes. Just after the 4136 kPa (600 psig) startup steam was introduced into the reformer furnace inlet, the control room alarm journal reported an extreme positive pressure spike at the same time a single loud bang was reported by the operations personnel on the furnace structure. An emergency shutdown of the furnace was initiated and the startup aborted. At the time of the incident, there were seven people on the furnace. Four were operations staff and three were maintenance personnel. One serious injury was sustained to an operator by flying shrapnel. There was no hydrogen leak or explosion related to this incident; the startup failure occurred prior to the introduction of methane for the hydrogen-generation step.

The cause of this incident was determined to be the initial steam flow picking up some remnant water and carrying it into the furnace. Under the conditions present, the water underwent an instantaneous phase change and the energy release was sufficient to rupture the hydrogen reformer furnace radiant tubes. The entire event was calculated to have taken only a few milliseconds, but involved extremely high-energy release rates. This high-energy impulse caused the simultaneous rupture of five tubes with sufficient force to eject portions of the tubes out through the roof of the furnace as shrapnel. All of the failures occurred near the inlet of the tubes in the headspace above the catalyst, and the five tubes were clustered toward the center of the furnace in four rows. Approximately 41 additional radiant tubes were destroyed as a result of impacts from ejected tube segments and the subsequent pressure wave. Extensive damage to the refractory also occurred. As a result, the furnace internal structure was condemned and a complete re-tubing was required.

某炼油厂的氢气转化炉停炉检修,拆除了一些辐射管的入口和出口封头,并将其封盖。在这次维护过程中,决定将蒸汽留在蒸汽产生回路中,以防止冻结。维护完成后,启动程序要求首先将炉子加热到 350°C (662°F),然后再将 4136 kPa (600 psig) 的蒸汽引入辐射管。就在 4136 kPa（600 psig）的启动蒸汽进入转化炉入口后,控制室报警日志报告了一个极高的正压峰值,与此同时,转化炉结构上的操作人员报告了一声巨响。炉子被紧急关闭,启动被中止。事件发生时,熔炉上共有七人。其中四人是操作人员,三人是维修人员。一名操作人员被飞溅的碎片击中,伤势严重。这起事故没有涉及氢气泄漏或爆炸；启动故障发生在引入甲烷进行制氢步骤之前。这次事故的原因被确定为初始蒸汽流带走了一些残余的水并将其带入熔炉。在当时的条件下,水瞬间发生了相变,释放的能量足以使氢气转化炉辐射管破裂。据计算,整个事件只发生了几毫秒,但却涉及极高的能量释放率。这种高能量脉冲导致五根管子同时破裂,其力量足以将部分管子作为弹片从炉顶弹出。所有故障都发生在催化剂上方顶空的管子入口附近,五根管子集中在炉子中央,分成四排。由于喷出的管段和随后的压力波造成的冲击,另有大约 41 根辐射管被摧毁。耐火材料也受到广泛损坏。因此,窑炉的内部结构被破坏,需要彻底重新装管。在熔炉上方和西侧的熔炉平台上发现了被弹片击中而损坏的灯具,绝缘材料和走道光栅。

The driver of the hydrogen truck trailer did not properly stow the hydrogen fill line after filling and failed to verify that the hydrogen fill line was clear of the trailer prior to departure. As the driver pulled away from the fill station, the hydrogen fill line caught on the trailer and subsequently pulled on the hydrogen fill station's ground storage tubes distribution manifold. The force of this pull bent the plant's hydrogen distribution manifold and hydrogen began leaking from a threaded connection and from the hydrogen fill line. The truck trailer driver reported hearing a ""pop and hissing sound"", stopped the truck movement, and then promptly left the truck to report the incident at approximately 6:45 PM. The local fire department was contacted and the building was evacuated. The fire department arrived by 8:00 PM, along with the hydrogen vendor's service technician, to isolate the hydrogen leak. The hydrogen leak at the plant's hydrogen ground storage system was stopped by closing the individual valves on each hydrogen storage tube, thereby isolating the distribution manifold. At 10:00 PM, the all clear was given. Hydrogen operations were restored to the plant the next day by removing the damaged hydrogen ground storage unit and replacing it with a hydrogen tube trailer with concrete barriers installed to provide protection. The hydrogen leak from this event caused no hydrogen fire/explosion or personnel injuries.
一家工厂的氢气加注站发生了氢气泄漏事故,供应商的氢气加注卡车拖车在加注氢气后开走,卡住了储存不当的氢气加注管线。氢气卡车拖车司机在加氢后没有正确存放氢气加注管线,并且在离开前没有确认氢气加注管线是否远离拖车。当司机驶离加氢站时,氢气填充管被拖车卡住,随后拉扯到加氢站的地面储氢管分配歧管。这一拉力使加氢站的氢气分配歧管弯曲,氢气开始从螺纹连接处和氢气填充管泄漏。卡车拖车司机报告说听到了 ""噼啪和嘶嘶声"",他停止了卡车行驶,然后迅速离开卡车,于下午 6:45 左右报告了事故。当地消防部门得到联系,大楼内的人员被疏散。消防队和氢气供应商的服务技术人员于晚上 8 点前赶到现场,隔离了氢气泄漏。通过关闭每个氢气储存管上的阀门,从而隔离分配歧管,阻止了工厂氢气地面储存系统的氢气泄漏。晚上 10 点,一切正常。第二天,通过拆除损坏的氢气地面储存装置并用氢气管拖车代替,并安装了混凝土屏障以提供保护,工厂恢复了氢气作业。这次氢气泄漏事件没有造成氢气起火/爆炸或人员伤亡。","None

Manufacturer weld defects on the SCW exciter end ring header are the likely cause for the hydrogen leakage.

The first nuclear plant shutdown was initiated in mid-May when an SCW leak internal to the main generator was confirmed. Events that led up to the shutdown decision started three days earlier and included an upward trend in stator coil temperatures. After two days of an elevated temperature trend, an SCW tank high-pressure alarm indicated hydrogen leakage. Per alarm response procedure, the operators vented the tank. Hydrogen leakage was determined to have increased from about 300 to 1400 ft3/day with stator water conductivity increasing from 0.1 to 0.25 μmho/cm. Shutdown was completed the next day and efforts began to locate and repair the leak. A pinhole leak (calculated to be 0.017"") was subsequently located at the corner of three welds on the lower west side of the drain box where two plates are welded to the SCW ring header on the exciter end of the generator. The defective weld was repaired and post-maintenance pressure decay testing confirmed that the repair was satisfactory and no other leaks existed. A preventive maintenance (PM) task was planned for the next main generator outage to remove paint and inspect other welds on the SCW for defects.

The second nuclear plant shutdown was initiated at the end of July with the same symptoms as above. Monitoring of SCW temperatures indicated that a pinhole leak had developed somewhere internal to the generator, thereby allowing hydrogen to leak into the SCW system. Power was maintained at levels to sustain SCW temperatures near normal as preparations for a forced outage were completed. Seven days later, the plant was shutdown. The leak was determined to be in the same stator water collector box as the leak above, but at a different weld. Except for the weld repaired during the first shutdown above, all remaining manufacturer's welds on the exciter end SCW ring header drain box were surfaced prepared, PT examined, and repaired as needed. Weld overlays were performed on all welds. A total of four welds required repair. Three of the four welds requiring repair were similar geometry to the weld repaired during the first shutdown. At reassembly of SCW equipment, various checks and tests were satisfactorily performed, including natural frequency and pressure drop testing.
主发电机定子冷却水（SCW）设备中的氢气和水泄漏迫使一家核电厂在三个月内两次停机。制造商在 SCW 励磁机端环封头上的焊接缺陷可能是氢泄漏的原因。

第一座核电厂于 5 月中旬开始停机,当时确认了主发电机内部的 SCW 泄漏。导致做出停机决定的事件始于三天前,包括定子线圈温度呈上升趋势。温度上升趋势持续两天后,SCW 罐高压警报显示氢气泄漏。根据警报响应程序,操作员对储罐进行了排气。经测定,氢气泄漏量从每天约 300 ft3 增加到 1400 ft3,定子水导电率从 0.1 μmho/cm 增加到 0.25 μmho/cm。第二天停机,并开始查找和修复泄漏。随后在排水箱西侧下部三个焊缝的拐角处发现了一个针孔泄漏（计算值为 0. 017""）,此处有两块板焊接在发电机励磁机端部的 SCW 环形封头上。对有缺陷的焊缝进行了修补,维修后的压力衰减测试证实修补效果令人满意,没有其他泄漏。计划在下一次主发电机停机时进行预防性维护 (PM),去除油漆并检查 SCW 上的其他焊缝是否存在缺陷。

第二次核电厂停机于 7 月底启动,症状与上述相同。对超临界水处理温度的监测表明,发电机内部某处出现了针孔泄漏,从而导致氢气泄漏到超临界水处理系统中。在完成强制停运准备工作的同时,将电力维持在接近正常的水平,以维持超临界水温。七天后,电厂关闭。经确定,泄漏位于与上述泄漏相同的定子集水箱中,但在不同的焊缝处。除上述第一次停机时修复的焊缝外,励磁机端部 SCW 环集水器排水箱上的所有其余制造商焊缝都进行了表面处理,PT 检验,并根据需要进行了修复。对所有焊缝进行了堆焊。共有四条焊缝需要修复。四个需要修复的焊缝中有三个与第一次停机时修复的焊缝几何形状相似。在重新装配 SCW 设备时,各种检查和测试均顺利进行,包括固有频率和压降测试。","None

The reactants were injected into an argon plasma flame to carry out the synthesis reaction.

After the run was completed, as per work control procedure, the experimenter removed the plasma torch from the top lid of the collection chamber and taped a piece of weighing paper over the opening so air would not get into the chamber and contaminate the product. The experimenter then installed a plastic glove bag over the top lid of the collection chamber and attached it just below the top lid using Velcro. Before final installation, the experimenter placed a screwdriver and a natural bristle paint brush into the glove bag that would eventually be used to gather the product sample. After the glove bag was installed, the weighing paper was punctured and the inert gas was allowed to flush the glove bag continuously for 15-20 minutes to displace the air within the bag before removing the lid.

In accordance with the procedure, the experimenter then used the screwdriver to remove the top lid of the collection chamber with purge gas still flowing. The experimenter donned white cotton liner gloves to reduce the potential of static electricity and absorb any sweat from his hands. He used the brush to collect the material from the wall and bottom of the collection chamber and swept the powder into a glass tube located at the bottom center of the collection chamber. As the product was being collected, the experimenter observed a small flash coming from inside the chamber and extending into the glove bag. The flash produced a whooshing sound. The experimenter, whose hand was in the chamber, felt heat through his glove, and the plastic on the right thumb of the glove was slightly hardened from the heat. The flash and the reaction products were contained by the glove bag and the chamber. The glove bag remained intact and no equipment was damaged. The experimenter instantly removed his hand from the glove bag and called the principal investigator (PI) and the department manager to explain what had happened. All activities in the plasma laboratory were stopped, personnel entry was denied, the laboratory was secured, and the incident scene was preserved. An investigation was launched to determine the causes of the flash.

In order for the flash to occur, both oxygen and an ignition source had to be present inside the glove bag. At the time the incident occurred, the normal inert purge gas (plant nitrogen) was being used in another project and was unavailable. A decision was made to use argon instead of plant nitrogen based on the immediate need for an inert purge gas. Argon had been used for powder feeding during the run and was available, so it was used instead. The most probable scenario for this event involves the changes brought on by substituting argon for nitrogen without evaluating the interaction properties of argon in a glove bag at a low flow rate.

During argon purging of the reactor system, the flow rate was set at 8 liters/minute, the same flow rate used for powder injection. After the incident, the experimenter attempted to determine the plant nitrogen purge gas flow rate, but it was significantly above the capacity of the largest flow meter available (10 liters/minute). Apparently, the plant nitrogen purge gas flow rate was much higher than the argon flow rate used during the incident. There may not have been sufficient volume of argon or enough time to purge the glove bag and create enough positive pressure in the bag during the work activities. Certain motions in the glove bag associated with collection activities may have caused purge gas to exit the bag (as designed), but when the glove bag needed additional purge gas to expand, it may have drawn in room air in addition to the purge gas, thus introducing oxygen into the glove bag.

The ignition source for this event may have been spontaneous combustion with oxygen due to the extremely fine particle size of the produced material (nanoparticles). For a flash to occur, the nanoparticles produced must contain some combustible or pyrophoric materials such as borohydride, hydride, carbon, or sodium metal. An electrostatic spark induced from the plastic glove bag could also have been the ignition source for the flash. However, if the inert atmosphere were of the proper quality, an ignition source would not be a problem.
2009 年 7 月 1 日,在一个封闭的反应室中进行了一次等离子体实验,用无水硼酸钠,甲烷和氢气生产少量硼氢化钠。反应物被注入氩等离子火焰中进行合成反应。

运行结束后,按照工作控制程序,实验员从收集室的顶盖上取下等离子炬,并在开口处用胶带粘上一张称重纸,以免空气进入收集室污染产品。然后,实验员在收集室顶盖上安装了一个塑料手套袋,并用尼龙搭扣将其固定在顶盖下方。在最后安装之前,实验员在手套袋中放入了一把螺丝刀和一把天然鬃毛油漆刷,最终用来收集产品样本。手套袋安装完毕后,刺破称重纸,让惰性气体持续冲洗手套袋 15-20 分钟,以置换袋内的空气,然后取下盖子。

按照程序,实验员用螺丝刀在净化气体仍在流动的情况下取下收集室的顶盖。实验员戴上白色棉衬手套,以减少静电的可能性并吸收手汗。他用刷子收集收集室壁上和底部的材料,并将粉末扫入位于收集室底部中心的玻璃管中。在收集粉末的过程中,实验员观察到从收集室内部发出一道微弱的闪光,并延伸到手套袋中。闪光发出嗖嗖的声音。实验人员的手伸进收集室,感觉手套发热,手套右手拇指上的塑料因发热而略微变硬。闪光和反应产物被手套袋和反应室挡住。手套袋完好无损,没有损坏任何设备。实验员立即将手从手套袋中取出,并打电话给首席研究员 (PI) 和部门经理解释发生了什么事。等离子实验室的所有活动都停止了,人员被拒绝进入,实验室被保护起来,事故现场也被保留了下来。启动调查以确定闪光的原因。

为了发生闪光,手套袋内必须同时存在氧气和火源。事故发生时,正常的惰性净化气体（工厂氮气）正用于另一个项目,无法使用。根据对惰性净化气体的迫切需要,决定使用氩气而不是工厂氮气。在运行过程中,氩气一直用于粉末进料,并且可以使用,因此就用氩气代替了氮气。最有可能发生的情况是,用氩气代替氮气时,没有评估氩气在低流速手套袋中的相互作用特性。

在对反应器系统进行氩气吹扫时,流速设定为 8 升/分钟,与粉末注入时的流速相同。事件发生后,实验人员试图确定工厂氮气吹扫气体的流速,但它大大超过了现有最大流量计的容量（10 升/分钟）。显然,工厂氮气吹扫气体的流速远远高于事件中使用的氩气流速。在工作过程中,可能没有足够的氩气量或足够的时间来吹扫手套袋并在袋内形成足够的正压。与收集活动有关的手套袋中的某些运动可能导致净化气体从袋中流出（按照设计）,但当手套袋需要额外的净化气体来膨胀时,除了净化气体外,它可能还吸入了室内空气,从而将氧气带入手套袋。由于产生的材料（纳米颗粒）粒度极细,该事件的点火源可能是氧气自燃。要发生闪光,产生的纳米颗粒必须含有一些可燃或发火物质,如硼氢化物,氢化物,碳或金属钠。塑料手套袋产生的静电火花也可能是闪焰的点火源。不过,如果惰性气氛的质量合适,点火源就不是问题。","None

When the leak was discovered, the gas oil hydrotreater unit shutdown procedures were immediately implemented and emergency response was requested. The refinery response team along with county response teams responded, and after approximately 1/2 hour, the gas oil hydrotreater unit was fully shut down. Shutdown consisted of sufficiently depressurizing the unit and adding nitrogen to allow safe closing of the leaking 1-inch gate valve and installation of the associated missing bull plug.

During this event, the 1-inch gate valve was found to be open roughly 10% with no bull plug in the valve, allowing the hydrogen to leak to the atmosphere. In addition, a 1-inch bull plug was found lying on the ground below the gate valve. This hydrogen leak vented and released approximately 133 pounds of makeup gas (~97% hydrogen) to the atmosphere, where it quickly dispersed. P

rior to the hydrogen leak occurrence, the gas oil hydrotreater unit and associated valve had operated at pressure (350 psi) for at least 36 hours. The gas oil hydrotreater unit involved in this incident had been recommissioned 18 months earlier after a company ownership change occurred and had undergone recent maintenance and testing prior to activation for operation. A post-event investigation determined the likely cause of the hydrogen leak was that the 1-inch gate valve was not completely closed prior to the start of operation. The investigation determined that a possible scenario for the loss of the valve bull plug was expansion and contraction during hot and cold cycling of the unit combined with vibration from a nearby reciprocal compressor over the 18 months since recommissioning.

The hydrogen leak from this event caused no hydrogen fire/explosion, no personnel injuries, no damage to the gas oil hydrotreater unit, no adverse environmental consequences, no offsite impacts, nor any significant threat to human health.
炼油厂气油加氢处理装置补给气管上的 1 英寸闸阀发生氢气泄漏。发现泄漏后,炼油厂立即执行了气油加氢装置关闭程序,并请求采取紧急应对措施。炼油厂应急小组与县应急小组一起做出反应,大约半小时后,气油加氢装置被完全关闭。关机包括对装置进行充分减压和添加氮气,以便安全关闭泄漏的 1 英寸闸阀并安装相关的缺失牛塞。

在这次事件中,发现 1 英寸闸阀大约打开了 10%,阀内没有防漏塞,导致氢气泄漏到大气中。此外,还在闸阀下方的地面上发现了一个 1 英寸的活塞。这次氢气泄漏向大气排放了约 133 磅的补充气体（约 97% 的氢）,并在大气中迅速消散。P.

在发生氢气泄漏之前,气油加氢装置和相关阀门已在压力（350 psi）下运行了至少 36 小时。此次事故涉及的气油加氢装置是在 18 个月前公司所有权变更后重新投入使用的,在启动运行前进行了近期维护和测试。事后调查确定,氢气泄漏的可能原因是 1 英寸闸阀在开始运行前没有完全关闭。调查确定,阀芯脱落的可能原因是机组在冷热循环过程中的膨胀和收缩,以及附近一台往复式压缩机在重新投入运行后的 18 个月内产生的振动。

这次氢气泄漏事件没有引起氢气火灾/爆炸,没有造成人员伤亡,没有损坏气油加氢处理装置,没有对环境造成不良后果,没有对场外造成影响,也没有对人类健康造成任何重大威胁。","None

检查期间","1. All samples with potential for hydrogen buildup should be limited to ground shipment only. (This shipment was by ground and air. If this incident were to have happened in an airplane, the consequences may have been worse.)2. All samples must be properly labeled before shipping. Hazard label warnings need to be located on the outside of the shipment package.3. The following safety information should be included with the shipment: the material safety data sheet (MSDS), applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs), and detailed information for the safe handling of the materials.4. Improper labeling can result in improper handling and storage. Lack of proper labels allowed the sample to be delivered to an office rather than a laboratory, where the material can be properly handled and stored in an approved location.5. For hazardous material shipments, do not ship material in quantities beyond what is needed by the receiver. Lesser material quantities lead to reduced risks in the event of a failure. In this incident, the analysis only required 0.1-0.2 gram of material, but 5 grams of the material were shipped. The receiver suggests that future sample sizes for this analysis be limited to a maximum of 0.5 gram (10% of what was shipped in this incident).6. Samples that have the potential for hydrogen generation should use a pressure-rated container with the following features:    a.  Head space to contain the maximum possible gas release from the sample below the container's maximum safety pressure limit.    b.  Pressure relief mechanism (such as a release valve) that can be slowly opened within a glove box to safely equalize any pressure build-up.    c.  Outer shell capable of containing any flying debris. A secondary metal container outside the pressure-rated container is suggested as a possible solution for containing potential flying debris.7. Sealed glass containers should not be used to store samples that could generate pressure over time. These types of glass containers are not rated for pressure. Capped glass vials, bottles, or metal cans are alternate options to consider.8. Safe transport and handling procedures for these types of materials need to be followed. The receiver requested that all shipments from the shipper of this sample be stopped until safety concerns from this incident are addressed.9. Store these types of materials in proper approved storage. MSDSs should be available either locally or at a central location.10. If a sample shipment lacks proper documentation, treat it as potentially hazardous until proper documentation is obtained.11. DO NOT become comfortable with handling these types of aluminum hydride materials. Routine handling of these samples without problems can lull users into shortcuts that could result in more damaging results than this incident. If this incident had happened with personnel present, there was a potential for personnel injury.Additional discussion about working with reactive metal-hydride materials in the laboratory can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website and in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
1. 所有可能积聚氢气的样品应仅限于地面运输。(这次运输是通过地面和空中进行的。如果这一事件发生在飞机上,后果可能会更严重。)2. 所有样品在运输前都必须贴上正确的标签。危险标签警告必须贴在运输包装的外部。3. 装运时应随附以下安全信息：材料安全数据表 (MSDS),适用的标准操作程序 (SOP) 以及安全处理材料的详细信息。4. 标签不当会导致处理和储存不当。由于缺乏适当的标签,样品被送到了办公室,而不是实验室,在实验室里,材料可以得到适当的处理,并储存在经批准的地点。5. 对于危险品运输,不要运输超出接收方需要数量的材料。减少材料数量可降低发生故障时的风险。在这次事件中,分析只需要 0. 2 克的材料,但运送了 5 克材料。接收方建议,今后这项分析的样品量最多不超过 0.5 克（本次事件中装运量的 10%）。6. b. 泄压装置（如释放阀）,可在手套箱内缓慢打开,以安全地平衡任何压力的增 加。建议在压力额定的容器外再装一个金属容器,作为容纳可能飞出的碎片的可能解 决方案。7. 7. 不应使用密封的玻璃容器来储存可能长期产生压力的样品。这些类型的玻璃容器没有压力额定值。有盖的玻璃瓶,瓶子或金属罐是可以考虑的替代选择。8. 必须遵守此类材料的安全运输和处理程序。收货人要求停止该样品托运人的所有货运,直到此次事件引起的安全问题得到解决。9. 将此类材料存放在经批准的适当仓库中。应在当地或集中地点提供材料安全数据表 (MSDS)。10. 10. 如果样品装运缺乏适当的证明文件,则应将其视为潜在危险品,直到获得适当的证明文件为止。11. 切勿轻易操作此类氢化铝材料。例行处理这些样品时如果没有出现问题,可能会让用户误入歧途,导致比这次事件更严重的后果。如果这次事件发生时有人员在场,就有可能造成人员伤害。有关在实验室处理活性金属氢化物材料的更多讨论,请参阅本网站的 ""经验教训 ""角和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A small research sample of approximately 5 grams of aluminum hydride (alane) doped with 2-3 mol % TiCl3 contained within a glass ampoule ruptured after transit while stored in an office cabinet. The rupture was attributed to over-pressurization caused by hydrogen gas buildup within the sample over a four-month period. The glass ampoule, contained within a 0.2-inch thick cardboard shipping tube, was not a pressure-rated container. The rupture resulted in glass chards penetrating the protective cardboard shipping tube. The aluminum hydride, a fine powder, was released from the shipping tube during the pressure release. The fine aluminum powder leaked from the cabinet and set off a local smoke alarm that brought emergency responders to the scene. No personnel were present in the area when the incident occurred at almost midnight. Inspection of the packaging after the incident did not show evidence of any fire or smoke associated with the glass ampoule rupture. No injures occurred related to the rupture.

If this incident had happened during transit, personnel injury and damage to surrounding material could have occurred. Similar injury and damage could have occurred at the receiver facility during transit, storage, or preparing for analysis.
一个玻璃安瓿瓶中装有约 5 克掺有 2-3 摩尔% TiCl3 的氢化铝（alane）,该样品在存放于办公室柜子中的途中破裂。破裂的原因是样品中的氢气在四个月的时间里积聚过多,导致压力过高。玻璃安瓿装在一个 0.2 英寸厚的硬纸板运输管中,不是一个耐压容器。破裂导致玻璃碎片穿透保护纸板运输管。氢化铝是一种细粉末,在压力释放过程中从装运管中释放出来。细小的铝粉从橱柜中泄漏,触发了当地的烟雾警报,紧急救援人员赶到现场。事件发生时已近午夜,现场没有人员。事发后对包装进行了检查,未发现与玻璃安瓿破裂有关的任何起火或冒烟迹象。没有发生与玻璃安瓿破裂有关的人员伤亡。

如果这一事件发生在运输途中,可能会造成人员受伤和周围材料损坏。在转运,储存或准备分析期间,接收设施也可能发生类似的伤害和损坏。","None

The chemical process utilizes electrolytic cells and is pH-dependent. Hydrogen is produced as a byproduct and is utilized as a fuel.

At the time of the incident, the plant was at an abnormal operating level of 25% capacity. A non-routine maintenance operation to repair high-pH liquid piping was in progress. To assist, operations personnel rerouted the high-pH liquid stream to the plant sump. However, in doing this, the liquid eventually made its way back into the electrolytic process by design. Ultimately this created the root cause of the explosive condition in that the pH of the electrolytic process increased faster than the computer-controlled acid-injection system could compensate for in this abnormal setup. (The acid system is designed to maintain proper process pH by lowering pH in the electrolytic process.) As the amount of high-pH electrolyte circulating through the system continued to increase, so did the amount of oxygen generated by the electrolytic process until the hydrogen concentration fell below the upper flammability limit (UFL). In spite of existing standard operating procedures (SOPs) and training, operations personnel on duty failed to realize and act according to the seriousness of the condition, and also questioned instrument readings.

After operating with the increased oxygen level and the hydrogen concentration below the UFL for several hours, the hydrogen ignited and an explosion occurred in the system. The explosion caused extensive damage to piping, process vessels and the containment building, but did not start a fire or cause any injuries. This event shut down the manufacturing process for over a week for emergency repairs.
一家生产用于漂白纸浆和纸张的氯酸钠的化工厂的氢气处理系统发生爆炸。该化学工艺利用电解池,并受 pH 值的影响。氢是作为副产品产生的,可用作燃料。

事故发生时,工厂处于 25% 产能的非正常运行水平。修复高 pH 值液体管道的非例行维护工作正在进行。为提供帮助,操作人员将高pH 值液体流改道至工厂底盘。然而,在这样做的过程中,液体最终还是按照设计回到了电解过程中。最终导致爆炸的根本原因是电解过程的 pH 值上升速度超过了计算机控制的酸液注入系统在这种异常设置下的补偿速度。(酸系统的设计目的是通过降低电解过程的 pH 值来维持适当的过程 pH 值）。) 随着在系统中循环的高 pH 值电解液量不断增加,电解过程产生的氧气量也不断增加,直到氢气浓度降至可燃性上限 (UFL) 以下。尽管有现有的标准操作程序（SOP）和培训,但值班操作人员没有意识到情况的严重性并采取相应行动,还对仪器读数提出质疑。

在氧气含量增加,氢气浓度低于 UFL 的情况下运行数小时后,氢气被点燃,系统发生爆炸。爆炸对管道,工艺容器和安全壳造成了严重破坏,但没有引发火灾,也没有造成人员伤亡。这次事故导致生产流程关闭了一个多星期,以便进行紧急维修。","None

Hydrogen system pressure is very important in determining incident response actions. Centralizing the system pressure indicators on a highly visible information panel located in a protected area of the hydrogen cylinder package is a possible solution to increase visibility.	Hydrogen valves should have a visible means to show that they are in the closed position. A highly visible lock or pin that can only be used when the valves are closed may help guarantee valve closure prior to transport. If the valve positions are visible, an operating procedure could be added that requires a final valve line-up check just prior to transport trailer departure.	Hydrogen cylinders grouped together and secured for transport as packaged assemblies should be designed for potential accident conditions. The package tie-down system should be designed with adequate safety margins to assure that hydrogen cylinder packages remain secured to the transport trailer under adverse conditions. However, the package design should assume that the package might fall from a moving transport vehicle and impact the ground, but the hydrogen cylinders should still be contained within the package. A program to test hydrogen cylinder packages under hypothetical accident conditions would be useful for developing designs that could be certified to survive potential accident conditions.
需要开发一种氢气管压力指示系统,该系统必须足够坚固,能够承受事故,无论阀门位置如何都能指示氢气压力,并且在事故情况下能够在安全距离外看到。氢气系统压力对于确定事故响应行动非常重要。将系统压力指示集中在位于氢气瓶包装保护区域内的高可见度信息面板上,是提高可见度的一个可行解决方案。氢气阀门应该有明显的方式显示其处于关闭位置。只有在阀门关闭时才能使用的高可见度锁或插销可能有助于保证运输前阀门的关闭。如果阀门的位置是可见的,则可以增加一个操作程序,要求在运输拖车出发前进行最后的阀门排列检查。将氢气瓶组合在一起并固定为包装组件进行运输时,应针对潜在的事故条件进行设计。包装捆绑系统的设计应留有足够的安全余量,以确保氢气瓶包装在不利条件下仍能固定在运输拖车上。不过,货包设计应假定货包可能会从移动的运输工具上掉落并撞击地面,但氢气瓶仍应装在货包内。在假设的事故条件下对氢气瓶包装进行测试的计划将有助于开发可在潜在事故条件下生存的认证设计。","A hydrogen leak and subsequent explosion occurred when tie-downs on a hydrogen transport trailer securing hydrogen cylinder packages failed. The tie-down failure caused the hydrogen cylinder packages to fall off the trailer and eject some cylinders onto the roadway (see Figure 1). The cause of the accident is unknown, but it appears to be unrelated to hydrogen (i.e., likely tie-down strap weakness or error in properly securing tie-downs). The cylinders contained compressed hydrogen gas at 200 bar (2900 psi). The accident caused some hydrogen cylinders to leak and the associated cylinder package plumbing systems were breached. A spark or other local heat source (e.g., from a nearby vehicle motor) ignited the leaking hydrogen and caused a deflagration/explosion that damaged a car following the trailer and broke windows in a nearby house. Emergency crews arrived at the accident scene and cooled the hydrogen cylinders with a water stream to reduce their temperature. No injuries resulted from this accident.

Side protection is especially important.	A system of designated lifting features is needed on hydrogen tube trailers to aid in accident recovery operations if the trailer is overturned or requires lifting. Typically, these types of accidents require the use of a crane for moving and lifting hydrogen tube trailers using lifting devices like slings. These lifting features should be designed to lift the hydrogen tube trailer with a full load of hydrogen cylinders and located at protected points. The current method for tube trailer lifting using slings around the hydrogen tube trailer at undefined locations and assumed centers of gravity is more hazardous and less safe.
氢气管拖车的后部需要加强结构保护,以便在发生事故时保护该处易损的氢气系统部件（阀门,压力指示装置,歧管,管道）。侧面保护尤为重要。氢气管拖车上需要一套指定的提升装置,以便在拖车翻倒或需要提升时帮助进行事故救援。通常情况下,这类事故需要使用吊车移动氢气管拖车,并使用吊索等起吊装置进行起吊。这些吊装装置的设计应能吊起满载氢气瓶的氢气管拖车,并位于受保护的位置。目前的氢气管拖车吊装方法是在氢气管拖车周围未确定的位置和假定的重心处使用吊索,这种方法更加危险和不安全。","A hydrogen leak occurred when hydrogen tube trailer traveling on a rural roadway left the road, overturned on its side, and resulted in a single hydrogen tube valve being opened or broken. The cause of the accident is unknown, however, it appears to be unrelated to hydrogen (i.e., it is likely that human driving errors caused the accident). The hydrogen tubes contained compressed hydrogen gas at 200 bar (2,900 psi). The back end of the tube trailer containing the high-pressure hydrogen plumbing and valves contacted the ground and resulted in the valve opening or breaking and losing all the hydrogen from one tube. The tube/valve that leaked was located on the bottom tier in the center position. The first firefighter crew to arrive at the accident scene verified that the leakage was limited to one tube/valve and that there was no overheating condition as verified by a thermal imaging device. The second firefighter crew (HAZMAT team),which was sent to recover the hydrogen remaining on the overturned tube trailer, determined that hydrogen recovery at the accident scene was not safe. The hydrogen tube trailer was lifted using lifting straps slung around the trailer near the hydrogen tube anchorage points, since the trailer did not have any fixed lifting points. After the tube trailer was righted, it was transported to the hydrogen supplier, where the hydrogen was removed and reclaimed. No injuries occurred related to the hydrogen leak.

System pressure components should be designed so that hydrogen pressure in the tubes is measured even when valves are closed and tubes are isolated.	Increased structural protection is needed at the back of the hydrogen tube trailer to protect the vulnerable hydrogen systems components in this location (e.g., valves, pressure-indicating devices, manifolds, piping) in case of an accident.

The cause of the collision is unknown, however, it appears to be unrelated to hydrogen (i.e., it was likely human driving errors). The hydrogen tubes contained compressed hydrogen gas at a pressure of 15 bar (218 psi). The accident caused a leak in the hydrogen plumbing system and deformed one of the hydrogen tubes, resulting in a 10-centimeter (4-inch) longitudinal crack from which hydrogen began to leak (see Figures 1 and 2). Fire from the conventional vehicles trapped under the hydrogen tube trailer during the accident ignited combustible components on the tube trailer (tires and fuel/oil), and subsequently the leaking hydrogen. Emergency crews arrived and cooled the hydrogen tubes with water to reduce the explosion risk and then put out the fire. No injures occurred related to the hydrogen fire.

Hydrogen was not in use by any process in the facility at the time. The flame was discovered by a contractor who was about to start welding on scaffolding about 3-5 feet away. Before starting, the welder searched the immediate area for any signs of fire per his training. When he spotted the flame, he called his supervisor.

An operator tried to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, which resulted in the flame enlarging by one inch. All employees and contractors were instructed to leave the area, and the EHS team leader called 911 and informed the fire department that there was a hydrogen fire at the facility. She then put an evacuation call out over the public address system. The administrative assistant hit the fire alarm on her way out of the office and went to the evacuation area. Then the operators began the process of shutting down the five furnaces that were online.

The EHS team leader met the fire department and advised them of the fire. They began blocking the street and preparing to enter the building. The decision was made to close the hydrogen valves. Plant personnel and two firefighters proceeded to the hydrogen tank to close the valves. The firefighters asked about the routing of the hydrogen line, the status of hydrogen tank valves, and the likelihood that the fire could spread to the nearby gas feed shelter containing the hazardous chemicals and the other flammable gas lines. It was determined to be highly unlikely that the fire would reach the gas feed shelter, so the firefighters decided to allow the fire to burn out. There was approximately 100 feet of line from the tank to the location of the fire. After 30 minutes, the fire was still burning.

The EHS team leader contacted the hydrogen supplier to ensure that the hydrogen tank was shut down properly. The hydrogen supplier's technical phone support also advised that it might require an extended length of time for the pressure in the line to drop enough for the fire to go out. This information was communicated to the firefighters. The hydrogen supplier also dispatched a technician to the site. When the technician arrived, he and the maintenance team leader walked through the emergency shut-down procedure for the hydrogen tank.

An operator and a firefighter, both wearing PPE and breathing gear, went back into the area of the fire to check if all equipment was properly turned off. They verified via the plant control system that everything was shut down. The firefighter checked the fire and verified that it had burned out. Plant personnel were then allowed to re-enter the facility.
在正常运行期间,一家飞机零部件制造厂发现氢气管线上的针孔泄漏处冒出两英寸长的火焰。当时该工厂的任何工序都没有使用氢气。发现火焰的是一名承包商,当时他正准备在 3-5 英尺外的脚手架上开始焊接。在开始焊接之前,焊工按照他所接受的培训搜索了附近区域是否有任何着火迹象。发现火苗后,他打电话给自己的主管。

一名操作员试图用灭火器灭火,结果火焰扩大了一英寸。所有员工和承包商被指示离开该区域,EHS 小组组长拨打了 911,并通知消防部门工厂发生了氢气火灾。随后,她通过公共广播系统发出了疏散呼叫。行政助理在离开办公室时按下了火警警报,并前往疏散区域。随后,操作员开始关闭五个在线熔炉。

EHS 小组组长见到了消防队,向他们通报了火灾情况。他们开始封锁街道,准备进入大楼。最终决定关闭氢气阀门。工厂工作人员和两名消防员前往氢气罐关闭阀门。消防员询问了氢气管道的走向,氢气罐阀门的状态,以及火势蔓延到附近装有危险化学品和其他可燃气体管道的气体供应室的可能性。经确定,火势极有可能不会蔓延到气体供应室,因此消防员决定让火势自行熄灭。从储气罐到着火地点大约有 100 英尺长的管线。30 分钟后,大火仍在燃烧。

EHS 小组组长联系了氢气供应商,以确保氢气罐正确关闭。氢气供应商的技术电话支持人员还建议,可能需要更长的时间才能使管线中的压力下降到足以灭火的程度。这一信息已传达给消防员。氢气供应商还派遣了一名技术人员前往现场。技术人员到达现场后,与维护组组长一起讲解了氢气罐的紧急关闭程序。

一名操作员和一名消防员都穿戴了个人防护设备和呼吸装备,回到起火区域检查所有设备是否都已正确关闭。他们通过工厂控制系统确认所有设备都已关闭。消防员检查了火势,确认火势已经熄灭。工厂人员随后获准重新进入设施。","None

The low consumption of hydrogen resulted from the shutdown of some production equipment and the delay of additional production equipment coming online. The tank size is too large for the facility's current hydrogen demand.The hydrogen supplier will conduct annual training on handling all types of gases used by the facility and will include the local fire department in this training. The facility will continue daily rounds to look for visual evidence of leaks, and the hydrogen supplier will exchange the 9,000-gallon tank for a smaller 4,500-gallon tank to significantly reduce pressure build up from lower usage.
由于设备消耗量较低,氢气从储罐中排出过多,再加上极端的温度条件,对压盖螺母产生了热应力,导致泄漏。氢气消耗量低的原因是一些生产设备停工,以及其他生产设备推迟投产。氢气罐的尺寸过大,无法满足工厂目前的氢气需求。氢气供应商将每年就如何处理工厂使用的各类气体进行培训,并将当地消防部门纳入培训范围。氢气供应商将把 9000 加仑的氢气罐换成一个较小的 4500 加仑的氢气罐,以大大减少因使用量减少而产生的压力积聚。","Hydrogen leaked from a 9,000-gallon horizontal liquid hydrogen tank in the rear of a high-intensity lamp manufacturing facility. The facility manager noticed the leak during his normal morning rounds and initiated the plant's emergency response policy, which included calling the local fire department. A large vapor plume (actually condensed moisture in the air) was visible 200 feet above the tank. The technician for the hydrogen supplier arrived on site, thawed out the ice buildup around the gland nut from which the leak originated using warm water, and tightened the nut, thus ending the problem. The technician verified that the leak originated from packing material around the valve that had come loose because of the recent extreme cold weather.

The fire department requested that the facility not shut down, but rather continue operations to draw normal levels of hydrogen from the tank. A checkpoint was established near the tank side of the building where hydrogen level readings were taken and reported every 5 minutes. Employees of the plant were notified to exit the front of the building in the event of an evacuation signal. As hoses were turned on by the fire department, a drop in water pressure tripped the internal alarm, causing an evacuation of the plant. All employees were accounted for and were asked to return to work, as this was a false alarm condition. Two local streets were closed, radios, cell phones, and other electronic devices were shut down within a 500-foot safety zone to eliminate any static electricity that could ignite the hydrogen gas, and airplanes were diverted from their normal flight path to the local airport. Firefighters set up combustible gas monitors inside the building, but no gas was detected. The incident lasted approximately two hours.
一个高强度灯制造厂后部的 9,000 加仑卧式液氢罐发生氢气泄漏。工厂经理在早上正常巡视时发现了泄漏,并启动了工厂的应急响应政策,包括呼叫当地消防部门。在氢气罐上方 200 英尺处可以看到一股巨大的蒸气羽流（实际上是空气中冷凝的水分）。氢气供应商的技术人员赶到现场,用温水解冻了造成泄漏的压盖螺母周围的积冰,并拧紧了螺母,从而解决了问题。技术人员证实,泄漏源于阀门周围的密封材料因最近的极端寒冷天气而松动。

消防部门要求该设施不要关闭,而是继续运行,从储罐中提取正常水平的氢气。在靠近建筑物储罐一侧设立了一个检查站,每 5 分钟对氢气水平进行一次读数和报告。在发出疏散信号时,通知工厂员工从大楼前方撤离。当消防队打开水龙头时,水压下降触发了内部警报,导致工厂人员疏散。所有员工都已到齐,并被要求返回工作岗位,因为这是一次误报。当地的两条街道被关闭,500 英尺安全区内的收音机,手机和其他电子设备被关闭,以消除可能点燃氢气的静电,飞机也从正常航线改道飞往当地机场。消防员在大楼内设置了可燃气体监测仪,但没有检测到气体。事故持续了大约两个小时。","None

运行期间","An investigation team was formed to determine the cause of this anomaly. The team performed a fault tree analysis which identified the following five main paths or gates: fault in the original weld, age, component not built per design intent, overstress, and design error. This led to 48 events on the fault tree, all of which were investigated. The investigation, analysis and testing determined that the first path, fault in the original weld, was the primary source of the failure.The fault tree analysis pointed to three probable and two possible contributors of the failure. The probable contributors included incorrect filler rod selected by welder, insufficient fusion in the weld, and insufficient weld penetration. The possible contributors included incorrect power level setting and incorrect heat level applied during welding.Materials laboratory work confirmed that improper filler metal (4043 Al) was used to weld the 5083 Al alloy vent pipe. The 5083/4043 combination is not recommended for Al welding per either current or past standards. In addition, the failed weld was a very poor weld, most likely a field weld. NDE data indicated a higher number and severity of defects in this weld compared to other welds in the vent line. According to the material lab's failure analysis report, the weld failure resulted from tensile overload originating at the bottom surface of the vent line during tanking operations and was likely the result of a single overload event.Vent line inspection was performed to identify other suspect welds. Inspection methods included the following: visual inspection, conductivity tests on both sides of each weld to identify the pipe metal (5000 or 6000 series Al), helium leak check of welds, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) using a combination of x-rays and ultrasonic testing, and silicon etch tests to identify weld material. The silicon etch test procedure was successfully developed in the course of this effort to identify 4043 weld filler material in the field.Instrumentation attached to vent lines during subsequent operations has provided data for the ongoing weld stress analysis and screening criteria to determine which welds required clamshell repairs. Weld defect growth/propagation can now be monitored at periodic intervals.An unexpected temperature difference of ~200 deg F between the top and bottom of the piping was found to occur during tanking operations in the same area of the failed weld. This temperature difference was responsible for the high thermal stress seen there. Data indicates that the peak stress in that pipe section occurred at about the same time that the weld failed and was higher than predicted.
为确定这一异常现象的原因,成立了一个调查小组。该小组进行了故障树分析,确定了以下五个主要路径或关口：原始焊接中的故障,老化,未按设计意图制造部件,过应力和设计错误。这导致故障树上出现 48 个事件,并对所有事件进行了调查。调查,分析和测试结果表明,第一条路径（原始焊缝故障）是导致故障的主要原因。故障树分析表明,故障有三个可能原因和两个可能原因。可能的原因包括焊工选择的填充焊条不正确,焊缝熔合不充分以及焊接渗透不充分。可能的原因包括功率级别设置不正确和焊接过程中的热量不正确。材料实验室工作证实,在焊接 5083 铝合金通风管时使用了不适当的填充金属（4043 Al）。根据当前或过去的标准,5083/4043 组合不推荐用于铝焊接。此外,不合格焊缝的焊接质量很差,很可能是现场焊接。无损检测数据显示,与排气管道中的其他焊缝相比,该焊缝的缺陷数量和严重程度更高。根据材料实验室的失效分析报告,焊缝失效的原因是在罐装过程中排气管道底部表面的拉伸过载,很可能是一次过载事件造成的。对排气管路进行了检查,以确定其他可疑焊缝。检查方法包括：目视检查,对每个焊缝两侧进行电导率测试以确定管道金属（5000 或 6000 系列铝）,对焊缝进行氦气泄漏检查,结合使用 X 射线和超声波测试进行非破坏性评估 (NDE),以及进行硅蚀刻测试以确定焊缝材料。在这项工作中,成功开发了硅蚀刻测试程序,用于在现场识别 4043 焊接填充材料。在随后的作业中,安装在通风管道上的仪器为正在进行的焊缝应力分析和筛选标准提供了数据,以确定哪些焊缝需要进行夹壳修复。现在可以定期监测焊接缺陷的增长/扩展。在罐装过程中,发现在出现故障焊缝的同一区域,管道顶部和底部之间出现了约 200 华氏度的意外温差。这一温差是造成该处出现高热应力的原因。数据显示,该管段的峰值应力与焊缝失效的时间大致相同,且高于预测值。","Hydrogen was found to be leaking from a vent line during cryogenic loading operations. The leak was attributed to a cracked weld on a hydrogen vent line that consisted of (1) double wall aluminum piping and (2) slotted spacers between the inner and outer line to provide a hydrogen gas blanket for insulation. The weld that failed was repaired using a ""clamshell"" over the area of the failed weld in order to support continued operations. A portion of the failed weld was removed for analysis prior to the repair. After operations, the clamshell repair was excised from the non-vacuum-jacketed double wall piping to allow further analysis of the failed weld. It was later replaced with a new half shell piping section.

Two vehicles were involved. Each vehicle contained a single driver (no passengers). Vehicle 1 was a Fuel Cell Vehicle. Vehicle 2 was a conventional Toyota Camry. Vehicle 1 was traveling west, approaching an intersection with a green light, and proceeded into the intersection. Vehicle 2 was traveling north on a cross street. The driver of Vehicle 2 incorrectly perceived a green light and proceeded into the intersection. The vehicles collided in the intersection.

RESPONSE: The police were coincidentally in the area and able to respond quickly to the site. The vehicles were moved out of the intersection. Vehicle 1 (fuel cell vehicle) shut down upon impact and was pushed out of the intersection by the police officer. The fire department and EMTs were called to the scene of the accident, and arrived quickly. Both drivers were examined by the fire department and refused medical assistance. Medical release forms were signed by both drivers. INJURIES: The driver of Vehicle 1 sustained minor injuries on the arm as a result of the impact from the collision. The injuries sustained by the driver of Vehicle 1 were minimal; minor scrapes and redness on the forearm in a 1 - 2 inch area. The driver of Vehicle 2 did not sustain any injuries.

EQUIPMENT DAMAGE: Both vehicles sustained ""minor to moderate"" front-end damage according to the Police report. The driver's side air bag deployed in Vehicle 1. The impact of the collision occurred at the driver-side front quarter panel of Vehicle 1. The frame of the vehicle was damaged too significantly to repair. Digital photos were taken of the damage to the vehicles to document the damage.

RESPONDERS' KNOWLEDGE OF H2: Several emergency personnel teams responded to the vehicle accident. Those entities are listed below with the level of training that they had received about hydrogen and the fuel cell vehicle.

	Police Department: Officers from the Police Department that arrived on site had not received hydrogen safety training.
	Fire Department: Members of the Fire Department participated in hydrogen safety training, when offered by the project partners, prior to vehicle deployment and the station opening. However, the Fire Department personnel who responded to the incident had not received hydrogen safety training.
	EMTs: The EMTs had not received hydrogen safety training.
	Fleet Supervisor: The Supervisor that responded to the accident had participated in hydrogen safety training conducted by the fleet agency.

SAFETY PROCEDURES AND DAMAGE EVALUATION: According to the driver of Vehicle 1, the vehicle shut down upon impact. The vehicle was designed to shut down upon impact to isolate the hydrogen fuel and high voltage systems. At the scene of the accident, a visual inspection of the vehicle was performed. Additionally, the vehicle was checked with a sniffer to ensure that there were no hydrogen leaks. The Fire Department and EMTs were last to arrive at the accident site, following the inspection of the vehicles.

The automotive company's preliminary evaluation of the vehicle following the accident proved that the safety systems functioned as designed. The Emergency Shut-Down Procedure activated, and the hydrogen in the storage vessels was isolated. Upon further evaluation, the automotive company determined that the damage to the vehicle was severe despite the appearance of minimal body damage. The impact of the collision occurred at the driver-side front quarter panel of the vehicle. The frame of the vehicle was damaged too significantly to repair. In order for the vehicle to return to operation, the front section of the frame from the damaged vehicle would need to be severed and removed. A frame from another vehicle would then need to be welded to damaged vehicle. The timeline for this process is lengthy, therefore, the vehicle has been retired and the fuel cell stack has been salvaged and reused in another vehicle. The fuel cell supplier conducted an investigation of the fuel cell power plant within the vehicle. The evaluation of the fuel cell proved that the fuel cell system remained intact and unharmed by the impact of the collision.
描述：2007 年的一个星期五下午,市区两条街道的拐角处发生了一起交通事故。事故涉及两辆车。每辆车都只有一名司机（没有乘客）。1 号车是燃料电池车。2 号车是一辆传统的丰田凯美瑞。1 号车向西行驶,在绿灯亮起时驶入十字路口。2 号车在十字路口向北行驶。2 号车驾驶员错误地认为是绿灯,继续驶入十字路口。两车在十字路口相撞。

应对措施：警察正好在该地区,能够迅速赶到现场。车辆被移出十字路口。1 号车（燃料电池车）在撞击后熄火,被警察推出了十字路口。消防队和急救人员接到报警后迅速赶到事故现场。消防部门对两名驾驶员进行了检查,他们都拒绝接受医疗救助。两名司机都签署了医疗免责声明。受伤情况 1 号车司机的手臂因撞击而受轻伤。1 号车驾驶员受的伤很轻；前臂 1-2 英寸范围内有轻微擦伤和红肿。2 号车司机没有受伤。设备损坏： 根据警方的报告,两辆车的车头都受到了 ""轻微至中等程度 ""的损坏。1 号车驾驶员一侧的安全气囊展开。碰撞的冲击力发生在 1 号车驾驶员一侧的前挡板上。车辆框架受损严重,无法修复。我们拍摄了车辆损坏的数码照片,以记录损坏情况。

救援人员对 H2 的了解：多支紧急救援队对车辆事故做出了反应。下面列出了这些机构接受过的有关氢和燃料电池汽车的培训程度。

警察局： 到达现场的警察局人员没有接受过氢气安全培训。
消防队： 在车辆部署和站点开放之前,消防队成员参加了项目合作伙伴提供的氢安全培训。但是,对事故做出反应的消防队人员没有接受过氢气安全培训。
急救人员： 急救人员没有接受过氢气安全培训。
车队主管： 对事故做出反应的主管参加了由车队机构举办的氢气安全培训。

安全程序和损坏评估：据 1 号车驾驶员称,车辆在撞击时熄火。车辆设计为在撞击时关闭,以隔离氢燃料和高压系统。在事故现场,对车辆进行了目视检查。此外,还用嗅探器对车辆进行了检查,以确保没有氢气泄漏。在对车辆进行检查后,消防队和急救人员最后到达事故现场。

事故发生后,汽车公司对车辆进行了初步评估,证明安全系统的功能符合设计要求。紧急关闭程序启动,储存容器中的氢气被隔离。在进一步评估后,汽车公司确定,尽管车身表面损伤很小,但车辆受损严重。碰撞发生在车辆驾驶员一侧的前四分之一面板上。车架受损严重,无法修复。为了使车辆恢复运行,需要将受损车辆的车架前部切断并移除。然后需要将另一辆车的车架焊接到受损车辆上。这一过程耗时较长,因此,该车已退役,燃料电池堆已被抢救出来并重新用于另一辆车。燃料电池供应商对车内的燃料电池发电厂进行了调查。对燃料电池的评估证明,燃料电池系统完好无损,没有受到碰撞的影响。","None

The cylinder destroyed the storage cage, then struck one of six stationary hydrogen storage cylinders used as emergency make-up for the hydrogen supply system. One of the hydrogen cylinders was broken away from its mounts and moved 10 feet from its original location. The loss of this cylinder severed the manifold tubing, creating a leak path to the atmosphere for the remaining five hydrogen cylinders. The leaking hydrogen gas apparently self-ignited, engulfing the immediate area. The site fire brigade responded and used hose lines from a distance to provide cooling until the hydrogen supply was consumed. The fire was out within seven minutes, and no off-site fire assistance was needed. All normal supplies of hydrogen were isolated and a re-flash watch was established until all damaged hydrogen cylinders were removed to an isolated ""safe zone."" Damage was restricted to the CO2 cylinder, the six hydrogen cylinders, associated piping (which showed flame impingement), and the compressed gas storage cage.

Preliminary results indicated that the CO2 cylinder rupture was caused by tensile strength overload caused by overpressurization. The safety disc assembly was dissembled and it was found to contain three safety discs where there should have only been one. Installation of multiple safety discs probably resulted in failure to relieve the overpressure condition prior to cylinder rupture.

The 4.0-m hose was in service for approximately two years, primarily for 70 MPa fueling of hydrogen at ambient conditions ranging from -40 C to +50 C. The total number of fills during its service life was estimated to be 150. In addition to the high-volume fill events, pressure cycling occurred as part of the routine test procedures and operational protocols. These additional pressure-cycling occurrences were approximated to be 200-250 cycles. During each filling cycle, the hose was allowed to bend during connections, as required by the situation. Failure of the hose occurred while temporarily connected to a gas booster, after 1-2 hours of service at 75 MPa. There were no tight bends in the hose during its final service application and no vibration present in the assembly.

Examination of the hose provided additional information. Failure of the hose occurred approximately 30 cm from the crimped end fitting. The hose contained three distinct kinks, or bent areas, all within the immediate area of the failure. However, the burst area did not show any obvious signs of previous damage or flaws. Some strands of the metal braiding exhibited corrosion attack, as well as gouge-type mechanical damage, but no fatigue characteristics or discontinuities were noted on the failed strands that were examined.
高压聚四氟乙烯衬里软管发生侧壁爆裂故障。这根 4.0 米长的软管使用了大约两年,主要用于在 -40 C 到 +50 C 的环境条件下输送 70 兆帕加氢气。除了高容量填充事件外,压力循环也是例行测试程序和操作规程的一部分。这些额外的压力循环次数约为 200-250 次。在每个充气循环期间,根据情况需要,软管在连接过程中允许弯曲。在 75 兆帕压力下使用 1-2 小时后,软管在临时连接到气体增压器时发生故障。在最终使用过程中,软管没有出现紧弯,装配过程中也没有出现振动。

对软管的检查提供了更多信息。软管故障发生在距离卷边端接头约 30 厘米处。软管有三个明显的扭结或弯曲区域,都在紧邻故障区域内。但是,爆裂区域没有任何明显的先前损坏或缺陷迹象。一些金属编织股出现了腐蚀和刨削类机械损伤,但在检查的失效编织股上没有发现疲劳特征或不连续性。","None

Additionally, the experimental setup was redesigned to include only electrical distribution that has been verified to be in compliance with National Electric Code and that is located outside the cage. Further, the experimental setup has been redesigned to include a hydrogen supply line shutoff, so that if the pressure reactor cell integrity is compromised, the hydrogen supply is shut off. The fume hood has been fitted with a hydrogen sensor. Lastly, researchers were reminded that hydrogen experimental setups should be verified by another person, and hydrogen-involving experiments should be carefully monitored.Hydrogen development work is inherently hazardous, and greater precautions than the norm need to be taken to ensure a safe work environment.
上述事件发生后,设计了一个坚固的笼子,以保护反应器免受外部条件的影响,并在反应器单元发生压力爆裂时保护罩内的物品和任何实验人员免受反应器的伤害。此外,对实验装置进行了重新设计,只包括经核实符合《国家电气规范》且位于笼子外的配电装置。此外,对实验装置进行了重新设计,使其包括氢气供应线关闭装置,以便在压力反应器电池完整性受到损害时关闭氢气供应。通风橱也安装了氢气传感器。最后,研究人员被提醒,氢气实验装置应由另一人进行验证,涉及氢气的实验应受到仔细监控。氢气开发工作本身具有危险性,需要采取比常规更多的预防措施,以确保工作环境的安全。","A hydrogenation experiment was being performed under 60 atm hydrogen, inside a high-pressure reactor cell. The experiment was conducted inside a fume hood and left overnight. The hood caught fire during the night, resulting in fire damage to the fixture, hood, and exhaust duct, as well as water damage to much of the building. Based on the local fire department investigation, the fire started from faulty electrical wiring that was used to provide power for reactor cell heating. The electrical fire ignited solvent that was in a dispensing bottle inside the hood, which subsequently overheated the reactor cell, rupturing the seals. The rupture released hydrogen from the cell and attached supply tank, further fueling the fire. Nobody was injured in the incident, and damages were limited. It took one month to complete repairs.

The apparatus had been routinely operated under argon and hydrogen pressures of 5-10 atmospheres for nearly two years. The apparatus had not been tested for operation at pressures greater than 10 atm.

A visiting intern, frustrated in attempts to hydrogenate magnesium silicide through ball milling in the previously noted pressure range, attempted to perform the operation at higher pressures. The approximately 70-ml reactor was loaded in a glove box with 0.5 g of magnesium silicide and six milling balls. Upon pressurization to 80 atmospheres, a 270-degree rupture occurred around the perimeter of the reactor. The blow-out of the reactor resulted in a very loud noise and the contents of the ball mill were thrown all over the lab. Since the pressure inlet valve is situated near the top to the ball mill, the intern's hand was in the path of the lift-off of the top of the reactor and the person received a deep, 3-cm cut on the palm of the right hand.

Several other laboratory workers heard the noise and immediately administered first-aid. Security, paramedic and environmental health and safety personnel quickly arrived and took charge of the situation. The intern was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where the cut was closed with about a dozen stitches. The intern was discharged from the hospital immediately after treatment.

一名来访的实习生在之前提到的压力范围内通过球磨氢化硅化镁的尝试受挫后,试图在更高压力下进行操作。在手套箱中装入约 70 毫升的反应器,反应器中装有 0.5 克硅化镁和六个研磨球。当加压到 80 个大气压时,反应器周边发生了 270 度的破裂。反应器的爆裂产生了巨大的噪音,球磨机中的物品被扔得满实验室都是。由于压力入口阀位于球磨机顶部附近,实习生的手正好位于反应器顶部升起的路径上,右手手掌被划出一道 3 厘米深的伤口。

其他几名实验室工作人员听到响声后立即进行了急救。保安,辅助医务人员和环境卫生与安全人员迅速赶到现场,负责处理这一情况。实习生被救护车送往当地医院,伤口缝合了十几针。实习生在治疗后立即出院。","None

The compressor sources hydrogen from a 44 MPa storage bank as suction and discharges it at a stop set point of 85 MPa. The compressor capacity is 0.71 m3/min (25 scfm).

The original notice of failure was through an inter-diaphragm pressure indication and alarm. There should not be any pressure build-up between the layers of the diaphragm. Upon opening, hydraulic oil was found, leading to the assumption that the hydraulic-side diaphragm was leaking. Although spare diaphragms and seals were available for on-site repair, difficulty was encountered in attempting to remove the compressor nut above the diaphragms. Similar difficulties were encountered when the unit was returned to the manufacturer.

A new compressor nut of a different material was manufactured, plated, assembled to the head and returned for re-installation and operation. However, upon commissioning, it was discovered that the unit was not developing hydraulic pressure. The root cause was determined to be a fractured plunger, likely damaged during earlier repair efforts. The plunger was re-manufactured.

最初的故障通知是通过隔膜间压力指示和警报器发出的。隔膜层之间不应有任何压力积聚。打开后发现有液压油,因此推测是液压侧隔膜泄漏。虽然有备用隔膜和密封件可供现场维修,但在试图拆卸隔膜上方的压缩机螺母时遇到了困难。设备返回制造商时也遇到了类似的困难。

制造了一个不同材料的新压缩机螺母,经过电镀后装配到机头上,然后送回重新安装和运行。然而,调试时发现设备没有液压。根本原因被确定为柱塞断裂,很可能是在之前的维修工作中损坏的。对柱塞进行了重新制造。","None

These safety interlocks need to be carefully incorporated into the initial building/plant designs and should consider all of the unexpected occurrences, such as the electrolysis cell bank losing power in this case, and the potential ramifications of such occurrences.
这起事故突出说明了正确设计安全联锁的必要性。这些安全联锁需要仔细纳入最初的建筑/工厂设计中,并应考虑到所有意外情况,如本案例中的电解池组断电,以及此类情况的潜在后果。","Hydrogen and chlorine concentrations at a certain plant are measured once each shift. On the morning of the explosion, the hydrogen concentration in the chlorine header leaving the cell bank was 0.47 percent. After passing through the chlorine coolers and liquid/gas separators, the hydrogen concentration of the gas streams increased to 2.5-3.2 percent H2, i.e., 63-80 percent of the lower flammability limit.

About 5 hours after the measurements were made, the DC power to the electrolysis cell bank was shut down because of intermittent power supply problems. At that time, a low-order explosion was heard from the chlorine dryer area of the plant. Thirty seconds later, chlorine gas began escaping from the chlorine header pumps, and another explosion occurred in the electrolysis cell room. The first explosion blew off the steel plate cover on the dryer by shearing off the 3/8-inch bolts on the cover. The second explosion blew off the heads of two electrolysis cells and broke 108 glass connections between the chlorine header and the cell bank. There was considerable damage to other chlorine processing equipment.

A loss investigation indicated that the hydrogen concentration in the chlorine header probably increased when DC power to the cells was cut off without completely shutting off the chlorine vacuum pumps. Thus, the vacuum pumps probably drew additional hydrogen into the chlorine header, and increased the hydrogen concentration further downstream where ignition occurred.

Although most of the incidents seemed to occur on the chlorine side of the cell bank, at least one analogous incident occurred on the hydrogen side of the cells, at a plant where poorly designed safety interlocks allowed the hydrogen compressor to operate after DC power to the cells was automatically shut down. This created a sufficient vacuum in the hydrogen header to draw residual chlorine in from the cell bank. It also broke the water seal on the hydrogen compressor, thus allowing air to enter. The hydrogen-chlorine-air mixture exploded in the hydrogen header, causing considerable damage to the header and the cell connections.
某工厂的氢气和氯气浓度每班测量一次。爆炸当日上午,离开电池组的氯气头中的氢浓度为 0.47%。在通过氯冷却器和液体/气体分离器后,气流中的氢浓度上升到 2. 2% H2,即易燃性下限的 63-80%。

测量进行约 5 小时后,由于间歇性供电问题,电解槽组的直流电源被关闭。当时,工厂的氯气干燥器区域传出了低频爆炸声。30 秒后,氯气开始从氯气集输泵逸出,电解槽室发生了另一次爆炸。第一次爆炸剪断了干燥器上的 3/8 英寸螺栓,炸掉了干燥器上的钢板盖。第二次爆炸炸掉了两个电解槽的盖子,并炸碎了氯气集管和电解槽组之间的 108 个玻璃连接件。其他氯处理设备也受到严重损坏。

损失调查表明,在没有完全关闭氯真空泵的情况下切断电解槽的直流电源时,氯气集管中的氢浓度可能增加了。因此,真空泵很可能将更多的氢气吸入氯气集管,并增加了下游的氢气浓度,从而发生了点火。

虽然大多数事故似乎都发生在电池组的氯气一侧,但至少有一起类似的事故发生在电池组的氢气一侧,在一家工厂,由于安全联锁设计不当,在电池组的直流电源自动关闭后,氢气压缩机仍在运行。这在氢气集管中造成了足够的真空,将电池组中的余氯吸入。它还破坏了氢气压缩机的水封,从而使空气进入。氢气-氯气-空气混合物在氢气集管中爆炸,对集管和电池组连接造成严重损坏。","None

The corroded pipe end leaked hydrogen gas, which exploded, causing oil to leak from the heat exchanger. The leaking oil developed into an oil fire, and the damage spread. The causes of the pipe end corrosion include the following:

	There was a high concentration of corrosive substances in the process injection water.
	The concentration of corrosive substances increased due to re-molding the heat exchangers.
	The shape of the pipe cap was dead end piping.

Incident: During normal operations at a fuel oil refinery, a pipe end in a desulfurization unit developed a hydrogen leak, which led to an explosion. The pipe end was located on an outlet header of a reactant condenser (a fin-fan cooler with eight runs), which was the furthest downstream in a series of heat exchangers on the reactor outlet side of the plant. Scale deposited and built up on the cap section of outlet piping at a heat exchanger. Corrosion caused by ammonium hydroxide and chlorine in the process injection water had progressed over time. The build up of these corrosive substances decreased the thickness of the cap section. In addition, a dummy support was welded to the cap section, which might have caused thermal stress. At this plant, the concentration of corrosive substances was controlled at a higher level than it would be at similar plants. In 1985, the addition of a heat exchanger and the rearrangement of heat exchangers at the reactor outlet were carried out to realize additional energy recovery. Therefore, the concentration of corrosive substances at the heat exchanger outlet increased. According to general opinion at that time, no one believed the wall thickness at the part would be reduced by corrosion, so the part was not selected for wall thickness measurements. Therefore, it was not possible to discover the decreasing thickness at an early stage. The cap section was at the end of an outlet header of eight heat exchangers, and the exit of the collecting pipe of heat exchangers had a dead end. In the dead end section, fluid replacement is difficult, and concentrations of corrosive substances would increase locally. Thus, the piping structure is an ancillary cause of the incident. At the time of the incident, the leaking hydrogen gas was ignited by static electricity and exploded. Other heat exchangers were also damaged by the blast. In addition, fuel oil escaped and led to an oil fire, which damaged near-by equipment and structures.

Response: An operator shut down the plant immediately after the accident. The fire brigade arrived and cooling water was sprayed on peripheral equipment.
概述： 在一个脱硫反应器出口侧的热交换器出口处,一个装有燃油的管端发生了腐蚀。腐蚀的管端泄漏出氢气,氢气爆炸导致热交换器漏油。泄漏的油变成了油火,破坏范围不断扩大。造成管道末端腐蚀的原因如下：.

工艺注入水中含有高浓度的腐蚀性物质。
热交换器重新成型导致腐蚀性物质浓度增加。
管帽的形状属于死端管道。

事故： 一家燃油精炼厂在正常运营期间,脱硫装置的一个管端发生氢气泄漏,导致爆炸。该管端位于反应物冷凝器（有八个运行的翅片式冷却器）的出口集管上,是工厂反应器出口侧一系列热交换器中最下游的一个。水垢在热交换器出口管道的盖子部分沉积和堆积。随着时间的推移,工艺注入水中的氢氧化铵和氯造成了腐蚀。这些腐蚀性物质的积累减小了管帽部分的厚度。此外,还在管帽部分焊接了一个假支撑,这可能会造成热应力。该工厂对腐蚀性物质浓度的控制高于同类工厂。1985 年,为了实现额外的能量回收,在反应器出口处增加了一个热交换器并重新布置了热交换器。因此,热交换器出口处的腐蚀性物质浓度有所增加。根据当时的普遍观点,没有人认为该部件的壁厚会因腐蚀而减小,因此没有选择该部件进行壁厚测量。因此,不可能在早期阶段发现壁厚的减少。盖子部分位于八个热交换器出口集管的末端,热交换器集管的出口有一个死端。在死角部分,流体更换困难,腐蚀性物质的浓度会局部增加。因此,管道结构是造成事故的一个辅助原因。事故发生时,泄漏的氢气被静电点燃并发生爆炸。爆炸还损坏了其他热交换器。此外,燃油泄漏并引发油火,损坏了附近的设备和结构。

应对措施 事故发生后,一名操作员立即关闭了工厂。消防队赶到现场,并向外围设备喷洒了冷却水。","None

The catalyst in a dehydrogenation reactor, which was usually operated under a hydrogen atmosphere, was changed while the reactor was isolated from the peripheral equipment by closing a 20-inch remotely controlled valve. The hydrogen pressure in the peripheral equipment was set at 20 KPaG, and the reactor was opened to the atmosphere. Anticipating some hydrogen leakage, suction from the piping was accomplished with a vacuum device and, nitrogen sealing was performed. When the piping connections were restored after changing the catalyst, flames spouted from the flange clearance and two workers were burned. One cause of the fire was poor management of the catalyst replacement process.

Incident Synopsis

A catalyst exchange was carried out in a dehydrogenation reactor at a linear alkylbenzene (LAB) manufacturing plant. To enable piping restoration after the catalyst exchange, a top flange with an elbow was mounted, and nitrogen purging of the reactor and piping was started. Leaked hydrogen gas ignited in the piping and flames spouted out through the flange during bolt tightening. The fire ignited the clothing of the two plumbers who were working near the flange.

The hydrogen flame spouted instantaneously, and no fire-extinguishing equipment was used. There was no damage to the plant. The clothing of the workers caught fire and they were burned. It was not recognized as a fire because there was no special damage, and it automatically extinguished itself. Fortunately, the workers were only slightly injured and their lungs were not burned.

Apparently there were two causes: 1) a leaking valve and 2) poor positioning of nitrogen injection. However, the work plan should have assumed that a valve might leak. When working with hydrogen gas, which easily leaks, using only one big gate valve with a 20-inch diameter to shut off hydrogen is not a good idea, since it can be expected to leak. Minimal countermeasures such as evacuating the leaked hydrogen with a steam ejector or sealing the system with a small quantity of nitrogen are inadequate.

The catalyst in this reactor is exchanged frequently, at about 55-day intervals. Therefore, to decrease the downtime for catalyst exchange operations, a new reactor isolation procedure with only one remote air-driven valve between the slightly pressurized peripheral section and the atmospheric pressure reactor vessel was proposed as a convenient method, and was approved by the plant manager. One cause of the incident might have been instituting a procedural change without a careful study, including an estimation of the potential hydrogen leakage, the nitrogen injection volume required for hydrogen evacuation, etc. The perfunctory study of potential safety issues that was executed for the revised reactor isolation procedure was inadequate to ensure worker safety.

Sequence

At 05:30 on April 12, 1994, the LAB plant was shut down for a catalyst exchange.

At 13:10, the remotely controlled air-driven valves at the inlet and the outlet of the dehydrogenation reactor was closed.

The top and bottom piping of the reactor was kept at 20 KPaG with hydrogen gas.

On April 13, the reactor was left in a sealed condition at 40 KPaG with nitrogen gas.

At 09:00 on April 14, the reactor was depressurized, the top cover (the inlet side) was removed, and the blind flange (a partition board installed at the end of the piping) was set at the end of the inlet piping, and evacuation started with a steam ejector.

At 11:00, catalyst extraction was started.

At 14:00, catalyst extraction was finished.

At 16:00, new catalyst loading was finished.

At 16:10, the blind flange was detached.

At 16:30, the top cover of the reactor was mounted, and substitution of air in the reactor with nitrogen started.

At 16:40, Flames spouted out through the flange, and two plumbers were burned while tightening flange bolts.

Cause

Piping around the reactor was kept at 20 KPaG with hydrogen gas to protect against air contamination. Separation of the hydrogen-pressurized section and the atmospheric pressure reactor was executed by closing only one valve. A steam ejector was running to remove any leaked hydrogen. In the last stage of work to mount the upper piping to the reactor top flange after exchanging the catalyst, the blind flange was detached so the upper piping could be connected. At the location where the blind flange was set, removal with the steam ejector had already started for the hydrogen leakage through the valve. Air entered the piping from the flange during bolt tightening work. The air and the hydrogen that leaked from the remote control valve generated a combustible gas mixture in the piping. The gas mixture was ignited by a static electric spark, which might have been generated from solid material adhering to the internal wall of the piping.

According to the work plan, injecting nitrogen gas would purge the leaked hydrogen. However, the nitrogen was injected at the wrong point, so it did not provide a seal as planned.

Response

The injured workers were taken to the hospital by ambulance. The flames automatically went out as the hydrogen gas was consumed.

Countermeasures

The previous catalyst exchange procedure was reinstated, with nitrogen purging of the entire reactor and piping system.
概述。

脱氢反应器通常在氢气环境下运行,在关闭 20 英寸遥控阀门将反应器与外围设备隔离的情况下,对反应器中的催化剂进行了更换。外围设备中的氢气压力设定为 20 KPaG,反应器向大气开放。由于预计会有氢气泄漏,因此使用真空装置从管道中抽气,并进行氮封。更换催化剂后恢复管道连接时,火焰从法兰间隙喷出,两名工人被烧伤。起火原因之一是催化剂更换过程管理不善。

事故概要。

在一家线性烷基苯 (LAB) 生产厂的脱氢反应器中进行了催化剂更换。为了在更换催化剂后恢复管道,安装了带弯头的顶部法兰,并开始对反应器和管道进行氮气吹扫。在拧紧螺栓时,管道中泄漏的氢气被点燃,火焰从法兰喷出。大火点燃了在法兰附近工作的两名管道工的衣服。

氢火焰瞬间喷出,没有使用任何灭火设备。工厂没有受损。工人的衣服着火,他们被烧伤。由于没有特别的损坏,火灾没有被认定为火灾,而且是自动熄灭的。幸运的是,工人们只是受了轻伤,肺部也没有被烧伤。

显然有两个原因： 1) 阀门泄漏,2) 氮气注入位置不当。然而,工作计划本应假定阀门可能泄漏。氢气很容易泄漏,在使用氢气时,仅使用一个直径为 20 英寸的大闸阀来关闭氢气并不是一个好主意,因为可以预料到阀门会泄漏。用蒸汽喷射器排空泄漏的氢气或用少量氮气密封系统等最低限度的应对措施是不够的。

该反应器中的催化剂更换频率很高,大约每 55 天更换一次。因此,为了减少催化剂交换操作的停机时间,有人提出了一种新的反应器隔离程序,即在轻微加压的外围部分和常压反应器容器之间只安装一个远程气动阀门,这是一种方便的方法,并得到了工厂经理的批准。造成事故的原因之一可能是在未进行仔细研究（包括对潜在的氢泄漏,排氢所需的氮气注入量等）的情况下就进行程序更改。为修订反应堆隔离程序而对潜在安全问题进行的敷衍研究不足以确保工人的安全。

事件经过

1994 年 4 月 12 日 5 时 30 分,LAB 工厂关闭,进行催化剂交换。

13:10 时,脱氢反应器入口和出口的遥控气动阀门被关闭。

反应器顶部和底部管道的氢气压力保持在 20 KPaG。

4 月 13 日,反应器处于密封状态,氮气压力为 40 KPaG。

4 月 14 日 9:00 时,对反应器进行减压,取下顶盖（入口侧）,在入口管道末端设置盲板（安装在管道末端的隔板）,并用蒸汽喷射器开始排空。

11:00 开始抽取催化剂。

14:00 时,催化剂抽取结束。

16:00 时,新催化剂装填完毕。

16:10 分,分离盲法兰。

16:30 时,安装反应器顶盖,开始用氮气取代反应器中的空气。

16:40 时,火焰从法兰喷出,两名管道工在拧紧法兰螺栓时被烧伤。

事故原因

为防止空气污染,反应器周围的管道被氢气保持在 20 KPaG 的压力下。只需关闭一个阀门,就可将氢气加压部分与常压反应器分离。蒸汽喷射器正在运行,以清除泄漏的氢气。在更换催化剂后将上部管道安装到反应器顶部法兰的最后阶段,拆卸了盲板法兰,以便连接上部管道。在安装盲板法兰的位置,已经开始用蒸汽喷射器清除通过阀门泄漏的氢气。在螺栓紧固过程中,空气从法兰进入管道。空气和从远程控制阀泄漏的氢气在管道中产生了可燃混合气体。混合气体被静电火花点燃,而静电火花可能是由粘附在管道内壁上的固体物质产生的。

根据工作计划,注入氮气可以清除泄漏的氢气。但是,氮气注入的位置不对,因此没有按计划起到密封作用。

应对措施

受伤工人被救护车送往医院。氢气被消耗后,火焰自动熄灭。

对策。

恢复以前的催化剂交换程序,对整个反应器和管道系统进行氮气吹扫。","None

Hydrogen leaked from the outlet piping of a hydrogen heating furnace at a fuel oil desulfurization cracking unit during normal refinery operation. The leaking hydrogen caused a localized fire. Dilution water for cleaning polythionic acid collected in the drain nozzle after a turnaround shutdown. The chlorine concentration in this dilution water was high because its concentration in the industrial water was originally high. The chlorine in the industrial water was concentrated by the high temperature, after the plant was restarted, and stress corrosion cracking occurred. Hydrogen leaked and was ignited by static electricity or heat.

Incident 

A fire occurred at the fuel oil desulfurization cracking unit of a refinery 257 hours after startup of the plant, following a turnaround shutdown. Stress corrosion cracking occurred at the drain valve connection piping located upstream of an emergency shutoff valve at the outlet of a hydrogen heating furnace, resulting in a hydrogen leak and fire. The design operating temperature of the unit was 538 °C.

During the turnaround shutdown, the desulfurization cracking reactor was neutralized and washed with a polythionic acid aqueous solution. The solution remained at the bottom of the check valve after flowing out of the drain valve. During startup, the remaining polythionic acid aqueous solution accumulated at the drain nozzle of the reactor inlet piping. When the high-temperature hydrodesulfurization gas was introduced, the moisture evaporated and the chlorine became concentrated. The temperature in the drain nozzle rose to the temperature at which stress corrosion cracking (SCC) could occur. SCC occurred in a high-stress component, and hydrodesulfurization gas leaked. The cause of ignition was considered to be either static electric sparks or leaking of high-temperature gas into the atmosphere. The main component of the leaking gas was hydrogen, which has a low ignition energy.

Although the drain piping material was austenite stainless steel, which could generate SCC, it is acceptable for normal operation and does not cause any problem if pure water is used for polythionic acid treatment.

Industrial water was used to dilute the polythionic acid. Therefore, the chlorine concentration was high in the polythionic acid aqueous solution that accumulated in the drain valve nozzle. In addition, the chlorine was concentrated by the evaporation of water due to high temperature after starting operation, and SCC occurred. Water management using industrial water is a basic factor, though there was a possibility of SCC due to chlorine.

The stress was generated by thermal expansion at the gusset supporting the drain piping due to a temperature rise after starting operation. There might have been a design error related to the support.

Sequence

July 3rd, 1999, 22:15. An operator on routine patrol found flames coming out near the emergency shutoff valve at the hydrogen gas heating furnace (F-102) outlet of the fuel oil desulfurization cracking unit. It was reported to the control room immediately.

22:17. Emergency shutdown procedures were carried out and the heating furnace (F-102) was shut down.

22:27. An emergency call was made. The self-defense disaster prevention organization was set up.

22:35. The private fire brigade started fire extinguishing activities until the public fire brigade arrived.

23:56. The fire-extinguishing activities stopped.

July 4th, 00:14. Flames were seen again coming from heat insulation of piping between the check valve and the emergency shutoff valve.

概述。

在炼油厂正常运行期间,燃料油脱硫裂解装置氢气加热炉的出口管道发生氢气泄漏。泄漏的氢气引发了局部火灾。周转停机后,用于清洗聚硫酸的稀释水聚集在排水喷嘴中。由于工业用水中的氯浓度原本就很高,因此稀释水中的氯浓度也很高。工厂重新启动后,工业用水中的氯被高温浓缩,出现了应力腐蚀开裂。氢气泄漏并被静电或热量点燃。

事件 .

一家炼油厂的燃料油脱硫裂解装置在停产整顿后启动 257 小时后发生火灾。位于氢气加热炉出口紧急切断阀上游的排水阀连接管道发生应力腐蚀开裂,导致氢气泄漏和火灾。该装置的设计运行温度为 538 °C。

在周转停机期间,脱硫裂解反应器被中和,并用聚硫酸水溶液冲洗。溶液从排水阀流出后留在止回阀底部。在启动过程中,剩余的聚硫酸水溶液积聚在反应器入口管道的排水喷嘴处。当引入高温加氢脱硫气体时,水分蒸发,氯气浓缩。排水喷嘴中的温度上升到可能发生应力腐蚀开裂（SCC）的温度。高应力部件发生了应力腐蚀开裂,氢化脱硫气体泄漏。点火原因被认为是静电火花或高温气体泄漏到大气中。泄漏气体的主要成分是氢气,而氢气的点火能量较低。

虽然排水管道材料是奥氏体不锈钢,可能会产生 SCC,但在正常操作中是可以接受的,如果使用纯水进行聚硫酸处理,也不会造成任何问题。

工业用水被用来稀释聚硫酸。因此,积聚在排水阀喷嘴中的聚硫酸水溶液中的氯浓度较高。此外,由于开始运行后温度较高,水蒸发导致氯浓缩,发生了 SCC。虽然氯有可能导致 SCC,但使用工业用水进行水管理是一个基本因素。应力是由于开始运行后温度升高导致支撑排水管道的夹板处热膨胀而产生的。可能存在与支撑相关的设计错误。

顺序。

1999 年 7 月 3 日,22:15。一名操作员在例行巡检时发现燃油脱硫裂解装置氢气加热炉 (F-102) 出口的紧急切断阀附近有火焰冒出。立即向控制室报告。

22:17. 执行紧急关闭程序,关闭加热炉 (F-102)。

22:27. 拨打了紧急电话。自卫防灾组织成立。

22:35. 私人消防队开始灭火活动,直到公共消防队到达。

	A solution of potassium carbonate was being drawn off to an inventory tank for a turnaround/shutdown maintenance activity at a refinery's hydrogen production unit. On the day of the incident, the solution level in the tower wasn't checked as it should have been, which resulted in hydrogen gas flowing back into the tank until the increased pressure caused the tank to explode. The direct cause of the incident was the workers neglecting to check the solution level in the tower. It is not known whether the potential for backflow of hydrogen gas into the inventory tank was understood beforehand or not.

Incident Synopsis
	An explosion occurred due to unexpected backflow of hydrogen gas while a solution of potassium carbonate was being drawn off to an inventory tank for a turnaround/shutdown maintenance activity at a refinery hydrogen production unit.

When the water solution in an absorption tower has carbonic acid gas drawn off, the water level of the solution drops. On the day of this incident, the level drop of the water solution was ignored, causing the pump to cavitate. Since the pump and a transfer valve were not immediately shut down, hydrogen in the absorption tower flowed back into the tank. The force of the flow blew scales and coarse particulates off the tank walls, which caused sparking and ignition of the hydrogen gas

The absorption tower for carbonic acid gas, where residual hydrogen gas remains, was not purged with nitrogen gas before turnaround/shutdown maintenance was initialized due to a mistake in the standard operating procedure. Another problem was the mishandling of pump cavitation by the workers. When the pump started to cavitate, it should have been stopped immediately. It is not known why workers did not pay attention to this procedure.

On reading the operations manual, workers reconfirmed that the tower level should be checked, the draw-off adjusting valve should be slightly opened, and the block valve should be throttled beforehand.

The physical damage to the facility consisted of a deformed tank roof and upper side wall, as well as damage to the windows of nine nearby buildings, their contents, and 15 vehicles.

事故概要
一家炼油厂的氢气生产装置在进行周转/停机维护活动时,将碳酸钾溶液抽到库存罐中,由于氢气意外倒流而发生爆炸。

当吸收塔中的水溶液被碳酸气体抽走时,溶液的水位就会下降。事发当天,水溶液的水位下降被忽视,导致泵发生气蚀。由于没有立即关闭泵和一个转换阀,吸收塔中的氢气回流到水箱中。水流的冲击力将水箱壁上的水垢和粗颗粒吹落,导致氢气产生火花并被点燃。由于标准操作程序的失误,在启动周转/停机维护之前,没有用氮气吹扫残留氢气的碳酸气体吸收塔。另一个问题是工人对泵气蚀处理不当。当泵开始气蚀时,应立即停止。不知道工人们为什么没有注意到这一程序。

在阅读操作手册后,工人们再次确认,应检查塔的液位,稍微打开抽水调节阀,并事先节流截止阀。

Employees in the laboratory were conducting high-pressure, high-temperature experiments with animal and vegetable oils in a catalytic cracker under a gas blanket. They were using a liquefied petroleum gas burner to supply heat in the process.

Investigators believe that a large volume of hydrogen leaked into the room through a pump seal or a pipe union, spread throughout the laboratory, and ignited after coming into contact with the operating LPG burner some 10 to 15 feet away. The flash fire engulfed the people in the room.

Other employees used portable fire extinguishers to extinguish the localized fires caused by the flash fire. The fire department received notification at 2:36 pm.

Responding personnel encountered a fire at the base of the plant's hydrogen storage towers, and they found the victim, who was burned over 90 percent of his body, some 50 feet away.

Officials determined that a pipe connection failed and that hydrogen, pressurized at 1,800 psi, ignited when it was released into the atmosphere, killing the plant operator.

According to reports, the pipe connection failure stemmed from pressures higher than design tolerance, which in turn were the result of over tightening that occurred during routine maintenance replacement. The new bolts were stronger than those they replaced, and the threads of the nuts had been partially corroded with age.

This combination of factors led to the failure and the flash fire. The facility's automatic detection system and wet pipe sprinkler system were not factors in the fire. When the plant's emergency response team arrived, it directed two monitor nozzles on the fire scene and the hydrogen towers. Responding fire companies added a third nozzle stream when they arrived at 11:50 am. The combined forces knocked down the fire in just over one-half hour.

官方认定是管道连接故障,加压至 1,800 psi 的氢气在释放到大气中时被点燃,导致工厂操作员死亡。

据报道,管道连接失效的原因是压力高于设计容许值,而这又是在例行维护更换过程中过度紧固的结果。新螺栓比被替换的螺栓更坚固,螺母的螺纹也因年久失修而部分腐蚀。

这一系列因素导致了故障和闪火。该设施的自动探测系统和湿式管道喷水灭火系统并不是导致火灾的因素。工厂的应急小组到达现场后,将两个监控喷嘴对准了火灾现场和氢气塔。消防队于上午 11:50 到达现场后,又增加了第三个喷嘴。合力仅用了半个多小时就将大火扑灭。

损失估计为 25 万美元。","None

虽然正常的防火系统可以帮助灭火,但如果安装了适当的氢气检测系统,再加上设计合理的通风系统,就可以完全防止事故的发生。氢气的上升速度是氦气的两倍,为每小时 45 英里。因此,除非屋顶或其他结构可以容纳上升的气体,否则物理定律会阻止氢气在其产生点附近逗留。目前还不清楚是房间的通风系统没有正常运行,还是通风系统设计不当；但无论哪种情况,电池充电设施都需要就氢气检测和排气系统的正确位置和设计咨询经验丰富的工程公司。现场标准操作程序还需要规定定期进行功能/操作测试。本网站的 ""经验总结 ""栏目将讨论电池充电设施的适当通风问题。","SummaryA fire occurred in a battery manufacturing plant that was about to cease operations for the night. The fire caused an estimated $2.4 million in property damage when an electrical source ignited combustible hydrogen vapors.BackgroundThe incident occurred in the forming room, where wet cell batteries were stored for charging on metal racks. The facility had a wet-pipe sprinkler system, but no automatic hydrogen detection equipment.Incident SynopsisAt 11:52 pm, a security guard on patrol noticed a free burning fire in the forming room and notified the fire department. It took fire fighters almost three hours to bring the fire under control.Although the facility was equipped with a wet-pipe sprinkler system, the forming room's branch had been disconnected 10 to 15 years before the incident. A press account said that acidic fumes from plant operations had led to repeated non-fire activations of the sprinklers in this room. The same account quoted a fire official as saying, ""If the sprinklers had been working, we would have gone in there, swept some water away, changed a few sprinkler heads, and they'd be back in business.""The incident report doesn't indicate whether the owners ever considered the use of listed, corrosion-resistant sprinklers in this area.Investigators determined that hydrogen gas, ignited by an electrical arc, was the cause of the fire. The hydrogen was generated by the electrical charging of the estimated 5,000 batteries on racks, and the electrical arc was initiated by the battery charging unit.
摘要 一家电池制造厂发生火灾,当时该厂正准备在夜间停止运营。火灾造成了约 240 万美元的财产损失,起火原因是电源引燃了可燃氢气蒸汽。背景事故发生在成型室,湿电池存放在金属架上进行充电。该设施有一个湿管喷淋系统,但没有自动氢气检测设备。事件梗概晚上 11:52 时,一名巡逻的保安发现成型室有明火,于是通知了消防部门。消防员花了近三个小时才控制住火势。虽然该设施配备了湿管喷淋系统,但成型室的支管在事发前 10 至 15 年就已被切断。有媒体报道称,工厂运行时产生的酸性烟雾导致该房间的自动喷水灭火装置多次失灵。同一报道还援引一位消防官员的话说：""如果自动喷水灭火装置一直在工作,我们就会进去,扫掉一些水,换几个喷头,然后他们就会恢复工作。""事故报告没有说明业主是否考虑过在这一区域使用列名的防腐蚀自动喷水灭火装置。调查人员确定,电弧点燃的氢气是起火原因。氢气是由架子上的大约 5000 个电池充电产生的,电弧是由电池充电装置引发的。","None

6 号储氢管的爆破片破裂导致氢气失控释放。由于水在与爆破片直接接触时膨胀结冰,造成机械应力超载,爆破片因此失效。正是通气盖（有缺陷的设备）的老化导致水进入爆破片。作为纠正措施,消除氢气存储组件中的爆破片。重新设计泄压阀的通风系统,防止或抑制湿气积聚,并允许湿气排出。调查发现了两起供应商掌握信息（""安全数据""）的情况,这些信息如果成功传达给工厂管理层并在随后采取相应行动,本可以防止或减少相关事故发生的几率。具体地说,氢气供应商在通风管道中发现了冰,并且知道通风口的盖子有裂缝（记得裂缝是涂过油漆的）。如果要求将这一信息告知工厂,那么工厂管理层就有机会对供应商的维护和运营计划进行评估并施加影响。作为纠正措施,将修改氢气和氮气供应的合同文件,规定如下：潜在危险设备供应商将向工厂管理部门提供书面文件,说明供应商的预防性维护计划,以便验收。供应商在完成每次预防性维护检查后,应向工厂代表提供一份预防性维护报告的副本。供应商应尽快纠正发现的任何缺陷。工厂管理层将向公司安全与健康经理建议,在全公司范围内实施上述合同文件修改。","Summary
	A hydrogen explosion occurred at a plant, damaging a wall adjacent to the hydrogen storage assembly. The investigation revealed that the explosion was the consequence of deficiencies in components integral to the hydrogen storage assembly, and that this assembly belonged to a supplier contracted to provide hydrogen to the plant. The analysis revealed that had the supplier properly installed and maintained this equipment, this incident would have been prevented. By receiving assurance, on an ongoing basis, that the supplier was properly maintaining this equipment, the company could have also reduced the chance of occurrence of this incident.

Background
	A hydrogen supplier was awarded a contract in 1990 to supply the plant with hydrogen as well as to provide on-site hydrogen storage. At that time, six hydrogen tubes, each about 23 feet in length and having a diameter of 24 inches, were installed at the northwest corner of the turbine house. They were arranged in two rows of three tubes each, stacked two high. For the purpose of this report, the tubes occupying the top row were numbered one through three, from north to south. The tubes on the bottom row were similarly numbered four through six. Tubes 1, 2, 4, and 5 were used to supply hydrogen to the station. Tubes 3 and 6 served as reserve storage and were isolated from the four supply vessels.

A valve and piping arrangement was fitted to the east end of the tube six-pack. It included two pressure relief valves: one plumbed into the four supply tubes and the other being shared by the two reserve tubes. Burst discs were fitted to each of the storage tubes at the west end of the six-pack. Vent pipes rose from each burst disc to an elevation of about 10 feet above grade. Five of the six vent pipes were plumbed straight and near vertical, and were each secured to the tube frame by two U-clamps. The vent pipe fitted to the No. 6 hydrogen tube was not straight; rather it contained two 90° bends, and it was secured to the tube frame by only one U-clamp. Concrete-filled steel bollards, located at 6-ft centers, surrounded the hydrogen storage assembly.

Findings
	The burst disc fitted to the No. 6 hydrogen storage tube had ruptured, allowing 14,500 cubic feet of hydrogen stored in the two reserve tubes to release to atmosphere. This burst disc was rated at 3,300 to 3,700 psi. However, the tank pressure at the time of the failure was only 2,100 psi. A pressure relief valve, set at 2,450 psi, was available to respond to any over-pressure condition. There was no known cause for, or evidence of, an over-pressure condition being reached. Therefore, the burst disc must have ruptured prematurely.

The remains of the burst disc were retrieved and submitted to a local engineering firm for examination of its fracture surface using a scanning electron microscope. This examination revealed that the burst disc failed from an initial overload imposed on the atmospheric side of the disc. The only known mechanism by which the burst disc could have been loaded in this manner is by the expansion of water as it freezes to ice while in direct contact with the burst disc. Temperature profiles are consistent with the formation of ice (tank temperatures were recorded to be 0° C for 48 hours preceding the incident, and ambient temperatures recorded at a nearby weather station dropped to -6° C on the evening preceding the incident).

Water could only access the burst disc after passing the vent pipe cap and a plastic weather membrane integral to the burst disc valve body. Caps were found on only two of the six burst disc vent pipes (on the pipes venting the No. 1 and 4 hydrogen tubes). Two additional caps were found on the ground under the tube six-pack. The four recovered caps were constructed of rubber and all were markedly degraded; each cap contained large cracks on their side surfaces. Two coats of paint, red over brown, covered the black rubber caps; brown paint was present on the crack surfaces - indicating both coats of paint were applied to the caps after the cracks had formed! The degraded state of these caps would have readily allowed water to enter the vent pipes.

The plastic weather membrane for the No. 6 burst disc valve body had been consumed by the heat of the fire. Examination of the remaining five membranes revealed each to be markedly degraded. If their condition represented that of the weather membrane for the No. 6 burst disc valve body, then water could readily by-pass No. 6 burst disc weather membrane.
摘要
一家工厂发生氢气爆炸,损坏了氢气存储组件附近的墙壁。调查显示,爆炸是由于氢气储存组件中不可或缺的部件存在缺陷造成的,而该组件属于承包向工厂提供氢气的供应商。分析表明,如果该供应商正确安装和维护了这一设备,本可以避免这起事故的发生。通过持续保证供应商对设备进行适当维护,该公司还可以降低事故发生的几率。

背景情况
1990 年,一家氢气供应商获得了向工厂供应氢气以及提供现场氢气储存的合同。当时,在汽轮机房的西北角安装了六根氢气管,每根长约 23 英尺,直径 24 英寸。氢气管分为两排,每排三根,每两根堆叠在一起。在本报告中,最上面一排的管道从北到南编号为一至三。底排的试管同样编号为四至六。1 号,2 号,4 号和 5 号管道用于向空间站供应氢气。3 号和 6 号管道用作后备储存,与四个供应容器隔离。六联管东端安装了阀门和管道装置。其中包括两个泄压阀：一个装在四个供应管中,另一个由两个储备管共用。在六联管西端的每个储存管上都安装了爆破片。排气管从每个爆破片上升到地面以上约 10 英尺的高度。六根通风管中的五根是直管,接近垂直,每根都用两个 U 型夹固定在管道框架上。安装在 6 号氢气管上的通风管并非直管,而是有两个 90° 的弯管,并且只用一个 U 型夹固定在管架上。装满混凝土的钢制系缆桩以 6 英尺为中心环绕氢气储存装置。

研究结果
安装在 6 号储氢管上的爆破片破裂,导致两个备用管中储存的 14,500 立方英尺氢气释放到大气中。该爆破片的额定压力为 3,300 至 3,700 psi。然而,发生故障时的储罐压力仅为 2,100 psi。设置在 2,450 psi 的泄压阀可以应对任何超压情况。没有达到超压状态的已知原因或证据。因此,爆破片一定是过早破裂。爆裂圆盘的残骸已被取回,并提交给当地一家工程公司使用扫描电子显微镜对其断裂面进行检查。检查结果表明,爆破片最初是由于大气侧超载而失效的。爆破片以这种方式加载的唯一已知机制是水在与爆破片直接接触时冻结成冰而膨胀。温度曲线与冰的形成是一致的（根据记录,在事件发生前的 48 小时内,水箱温度为 0°C,而附近气象站记录的环境温度在事件发生前的晚上降至 -6°C）。

水只有通过排气管盖和与爆破片阀体连为一体的塑料耐候膜后才能进入爆破片。在六根爆破片通风管道中,只在两根（1 号和 4 号氢气管的通风管道）上发现了盖子。在六根氢气管下方的地面上还发现了另外两个盖子。找到的四个盖子均由橡胶制成,而且都已明显退化；每个盖子的侧面都有大裂缝。黑色橡胶盖子上有两层油漆,红色覆盖在棕色上；裂缝表面有棕色油漆--这表明盖子上的两层油漆都是在裂缝形成后涂上的！这些盖子的退化状态很容易让水进入通风管道。

6 号爆破片阀体的塑料耐候膜已被大火的高温烧毁。对其余 5 个塑料膜的检查显示,每个塑料膜都已明显退化。如果它们的状况与 6 号爆破片阀体的耐候膜相同,那么水很容易通过 6 号爆破片的耐候膜。","None

	During operation of a succinic acid plant, hydrogen leaked from a mounting joint on a safety valve at the upper part of a reactor, which generated a hydrogen flame. Prior to the incident, the safety valve was removed and reattached during an inspection at a turnaround shutdown. An incorrectly sized, smaller gasket was installed on the joint, and the tightening force on the bolts was inadequate. Therefore, a gap was generated as time went by and un-reacted hydrogen leaked.

Background
	In the case of many leak tests after construction, a leak is checked by a soap test after pressurizing piping and facilities for the test. (A soap test is conducted by pouring soap suds at the place to be checked (mainly a joint part) after pressurizing. If bubbles are found, that is the evidence of a leak.) The gasket and bolt torque applied to a given piece of equipment is specified according to physical properties of the flowing liquid, temperature, long-term use, etc., yet, passing of a leak test is not guaranteed for long-term use. Moreover, regarding a bolt tightness check, the tightness is usually checked by striking a bolt lightly with a small hammer (called a hammering test). In this particular incident, a torque measurement test was never performed. Also, it is difficult to find a defect from a general examination after completion of construction.

Incident
	A hydrogenation reaction of maleic anhydride for manufacturing succinic acid was finished. While an operator went to the site for confirmation, he found a flame jetting from a flange that joined a safety valve to a reactor.

Sequence

	On May 9th during a turnaround shutdown, a safety valve of a reactor was removed for inspection.
	On May 16th the safety valve was attached again with a new gasket.
	On May 25th an air tightness test at the joint was conducted.
	On June 8th at 12:15 the manufacture of succinic acid started. Raw materials were automatically charged to the reactor, and a reaction started.
	At 15:05 the feed rate of hydrogen fell, and the pressure rose. A low-temperature alarm sounded simultaneously.
	At 15:10 an operator went to the site to open a steam valve. He found a pale flame from the upper part of the reactor.
	A hose was immediately connected to the water service faucet and the fire was extinguished by spraying water.
	The operation of the reactor was stopped and nitrogen gas was introduced to the reactor. Occurrence of the fire was reported to the office.

Causes
	An incorrectly sized gasket, which was smaller than the original gasket was used in a joint of a safety valve at the time of a turnaround shutdown. This caused an unbalanced force across the valve and an unequal tightness of the connecting bolts. Due to the small size of the gasket and looseness of bolts, the weight of the piping was applied locally to the joint, and the joint inclined gradually. Eventually un-reacted hydrogen blew out from a gap due to the inclination, and it was ignited by static electricity sparks.

This incident illustrates several problems. During the construction process, procedures for managing component parts and for securely tightening bolts were inadequate. After construction was completed, the construction check process and the leak test were not adequate in identifying and correcting the problems and avoiding the incident.

Response

	Water was sprayed using a faucet.
	Operation of the plant was stopped.
	Nitrogen gas was introduced to the reaction system.
概述
在一家琥珀酸工厂的运行过程中,氢气从反应器上部安全阀的安装接头处泄漏,产生了氢火焰。事故发生前,该安全阀被拆下,并在一次周转停机检查中被重新安装。在连接处安装了一个尺寸不正确,较小的垫片,而且螺栓的紧固力不足。因此,随着时间的推移产生了间隙,未反应的氢气泄漏。

背景情况
在施工后进行的许多泄漏测试中,都是在对管道和设施加压后通过肥皂测试来检查泄漏。(肥皂测试是在加压后向需要检查的地方（主要是连接部分）倒入肥皂沫。如果发现气泡,即为泄漏的证据）。) 适用于特定设备的垫片和螺栓扭矩是根据流动液体的物理特性,温度,长期使用等因素确定的。然而,通过泄漏测试并不能保证长期使用。此外,关于螺栓紧固性检查,通常是用小锤子轻轻敲击螺栓（称为敲击试验）来检查紧固性。在此次事件中,从未进行过扭矩测量测试。此外,在施工完成后进行一般检查也很难发现缺陷。事件
用于制造丁二酸的马来酸酐氢化反应已经完成。当一名操作员前往现场确认时,发现火焰从连接安全阀和反应器的法兰喷射而出。

事件经过。

5 月 9 日,在一次周转停机过程中,一个反应器的安全阀被拆下检查。
5 月 16 日,用一个新的垫圈重新连接了安全阀。
5 月 25 日,对连接处进行了气密性测试。
6 月 8 日 12:15 开始生产琥珀酸。原料自动装入反应器并开始反应。
15:05 时,氢气进料速度下降,压力上升。低温警报同时响起。
15:10 时,一名操作员前往现场打开蒸汽阀门。他发现反应堆上部冒出淡淡的火焰。
他立即将一根水管连接到供水龙头上,通过喷水将火扑灭。
反应堆的运行被停止,氮气被引入反应堆。火灾发生情况已报告给办公室。

起火原因
在一次周转停机过程中,安全阀接头处使用了一个尺寸不正确的垫圈,该垫圈比原来的垫圈小。这导致阀门受力不平衡,连接螺栓的松紧度不均。由于垫片尺寸较小,螺栓松动,管道的重量作用在接头局部,接头逐渐倾斜。最终,未反应的氢气从倾斜造成的缝隙中喷出,并被静电火花点燃。

这一事件说明了几个问题。在施工过程中,部件管理和螺栓紧固程序不当。施工完成后,施工检查程序和泄漏测试未能充分发现和纠正问题,避免事故的发生。

应对措施

使用水龙头喷水。
停止工厂运行。
将氮气引入反应系统。","None

运行期间","Lessons Learned The site initiated the establishment of a field patrol and strengthened their onsite monitoring of mechanical equipment during a plant-wide temperature rise.	Quantitative control of tightening torque on bolts should be carefully executed at all high-temperature and high-pressure plants.	A plant must pay close attention to both the chemical impacts and the mechanical impacts of an unexpected temperature rise during start-up operations.Several factors are important for flange use in applications of this type. Bolting patterns/torque order need to be considered in engineering, training, stewardship, and maintenance aspects of the specific operations. Cold bolt torque requirements should be developed so hot bolting is not required or relied upon for start-up. Flange stress from an increased or decreased operating temperature needs to always be checked. Substantial industry knowledge and practice exist for flange use to ensure that such operations are conducted safely.
经验教训 在全厂温度升高期间,该厂启动了现场巡逻,并加强了对机械设备的现场监控。所有高温高压工厂都应认真执行螺栓拧紧扭矩的定量控制。工厂必须密切关注启动过程中意外升温的化学影响和机械影响。在此类应用中使用法兰有几个重要因素。在具体操作的工程设计,培训,管理和维护方面,需要考虑螺栓模式/扭矩顺序。应制定冷螺栓扭矩要求,以便在启动时不需要或不依赖热螺栓。需要经常检查工作温度升高或降低所产生的法兰应力。法兰使用方面存在大量的行业知识和实践,可确保此类操作安全进行。","Overview
	During start-up operation of a high-temperature, high-pressure plant using hydrogen, hydrogen gas leaked from the flange of a heat exchanger and a fire occurred. The leakage occurred for two reasons:

	Insufficient tightening torque control was carried out during hot-bolting and an unbalanced force was generated across the bolts.
	A temperature rise was induced across the heat exchanger as a result of a revamping activity, during a turnaround shutdown.

Background
	Hot-bolting: In equipment and piping that operate at high temperatures, as the temperatures rise, the tightening force decreases, thus re-tightening of bolts is necessary. This work is called hot-bolting. The design conditions of the evaporator where the fire occurred were 2.4 MPaG, and 500 °C at the shell side, and 2.8 MpaG, 300 °C at the tube side, and it required hot-bolting.

Sequence of Events

	A turnaround shutdown of the benzene manufacturing plant was carried out in June.
	A gas-tightness test with real gas (hydrogen and another gas) was completed in September, and normal plant operation was initiated.
	During warm-up operation of the benzene manufacturing plant, which uses hydrogen at high temperatures and pressures; hydrogen gas leaked through a heat exchanger flange, and a fire occurred. At the plant, benzene was produced by a dealkylation reaction using toluene and C9 aromatic hydrocarbon as raw material.

 

Causes

	There was unbalanced tightening torque among bolts of the flange.
	The shell-side inlet temperature rose from the previous 400 °C to 420 °C as a result of an energy-saving revamping.
	A decrease in tightening torque was locally generated by a difference in thermal expansion between bolts made of stainless steel and the flange made of carbon steel. Thermal expansion of stainless steel is greater than that of carbon steel.
	The ignition source was considered to be static electricity generated at leakage.
	Quantitative control of tightening torque of the bolt was insufficient, and there was a local shortage of initial tightening torque.
	It is speculated that there might be an insufficient work standard for hot-bolting or imperfect execution of hot-bolting.
	The temperature rose as a result of an energy-saving revamping, and the effects might have been overlooked.

 
概述
在一家使用氢气的高温高压工厂的启动运行过程中,氢气从热交换器的法兰处泄漏并引发火灾。发生泄漏的原因有两个：.

热螺栓拧紧过程中拧紧力矩控制不当,在螺栓上产生了不平衡力。
热交换器在周转停机期间进行的改造活动导致温度升高。

背景情况
热螺栓连接： 在高温下运行的设备和管道中,随着温度的升高,紧固力会减小,因此有必要重新紧固螺栓。这项工作称为热螺栓连接。发生火灾的蒸发器的设计条件为 2. 4 MPaG,壳侧温度为 500 °C,管侧温度为 2.8 MpaG,300 °C,因此需要进行热螺栓连接。

事件经过。

6 月,苯生产厂进行了周转停产。
9 月完成了实际气体（氢气和另一种气体）的气密性测试,并开始正常运行。
苯生产厂在高温高压下使用氢气,在预热运行期间,氢气从热交换器法兰泄漏,并引发火灾。在 t

  .

原因

法兰螺栓的紧固扭矩不平衡。
由于节能改造,壳侧入口温度从之前的 400 °C 升至 420 °C。
不锈钢螺栓和碳钢法兰之间的热膨胀差异导致拧紧扭矩下降。不锈钢的热膨胀大于碳钢。
点火源被认为是泄漏时产生的静电。
螺栓拧紧力矩的定量控制不足,初始拧紧力矩局部不足。
据推测,可能存在热铆接工作标准不足或热铆接执行不完善的问题。
节能改造导致温度升高,其影响可能被忽视。

运行期间","Normally hydrogen fires are not extinguished until the supply of hydrogen has been shut off due to the danger of re-ignition and explosion. During a gas leak/fire, it is important to shut off the source of the hydrogen if it is safe to do so. If the leak cannot be stopped, the danger of a fire (or an explosion if the unburned hydrogen gas is leaking into a poorly ventilated confined space) would be very high. If a leak cannot be stopped, fire extinguishing is impossible and only prevention of fire spreading is possible. It is also difficult to detect a gas leak from thermally insulated piping at an early stage.Countermeasures which were employed to prevent future occurrences include:	Improving management of construction at turnaround to prevent improper gasket installations.	To detect gas leaks in piping systems covered with thermal insulation, inspection windows were installed in the insulation and gas leak checks were strengthened.
由于存在复燃和爆炸的危险,通常在氢气供应被切断之前,氢气火灾是不会被扑灭的。在发生气体泄漏/火灾时,如果安全,必须关闭氢气源。如果无法阻止泄漏,火灾（或爆炸,如果未燃烧的氢气泄漏到通风不良的密闭空间）的危险性将非常高。如果无法阻止泄漏,就无法灭火,只能防止火势蔓延。此外,也很难在早期发现隔热管道的气体泄漏。为防止今后再次发生此类事件而采取的对策包括：改善周转车间的施工管理,防止垫片安装不当。为了检测隔热管道系统中的气体泄漏,在隔热层上安装了检查窗,并加强了气体泄漏检查。","Overview
	A hydrogen leak and fire occurred due to the installation of an incorrectly sized gasket at a solvent manufacturing plant. A worn gasket was accidentally replaced with a new gasket that was smaller than the standard one, and the system could not withstand the operational pressure of the hydrogen, causing the hydrogen to leak and ignite a small fire. Furthermore, a nearby gasket was damaged by the fire, causing a larger quantity of hydrogen to leak, and the fire spread. As nitrogen was substituted for the combustible hydrogen gas in the piping at an early stage of the fire, damage was limited to the immediate area. If the hydrogen had not been quickly purged from the system, the fire damage would have been greater. It is assumed that gasket management at a turnaround shutdown was the cause.

Incident Synopsis
	A worn gasket was replaced with a somewhat smaller one, and was used to rejoin the flange of a valve at a solvent manufacturing plant. The system was then activated and the system pressure gradually rose, until the plant shifted into usual continuous operation. After operation restarted, the smaller gasket, which was about 1/7th the width of the standard one, could not withstand the pressure of the compressed hydrogen. Hydrogen began to leak from the flange and was ignited by static electricity, causing a small fire in the thermal insulation. A flange of an adjacent drain valve, and the thermal insulation on the valve, were also damaged. A large quantity of hydrogen leaked from the flange of the drain valve, and the fire spread. The plant was urgently shut down and employees carried out initial fire fighting and nitrogen substitution. The fire department was notified about the fire, and the fire fighters injected nitrogen into the system until the fire burned itself out and was confirmed to be extinguished.

The cause of the incident was human error in removing a worn component and installing the wrong replacement part. After a gasket replacement, a leak test is usually performed. The new gasket passed the leak test at the time of this incident, probably because the test duration was very short.

The physical damage incurred during the incident was concentrated on nearby piping and surrounding thermal insulation.
概述
一家溶剂制造厂由于安装了尺寸不正确的垫圈而发生了氢气泄漏和火灾。一个磨损的垫圈意外地被一个比标准垫圈小的新垫圈取代,系统无法承受氢气的运行压力,导致氢气泄漏并引发小火。此外,附近的垫圈也被大火烧坏,导致更大量的氢气泄漏,火势蔓延。由于在火灾初期用氮气代替了管道中的可燃氢气,因此损失仅限于附近区域。如果没有从系统中迅速清除氢气,火灾造成的损失会更大。据推测,起火原因是在转炉停机时对垫片进行了管理。

事件概述
在一家溶剂制造厂,一个磨损的垫片被换成了一个稍小的垫片,并被用来重新连接阀门的法兰。随后系统启动,系统压力逐渐上升,直到工厂转入正常的连续运行。重新启动后,宽度约为标准垫片 1/7 的较小垫片无法承受压缩氢的压力。氢气开始从法兰处泄漏,并被静电点燃,在隔热层中引发了小火。相邻排水阀的法兰和阀门上的隔热材料也被损坏。大量氢气从排水阀法兰处泄漏,火势蔓延。工厂被紧急关闭,员工进行了初步灭火和氮气置换。消防部门接到火灾通知后,消防员向系统注入氮气,直到火势自行熄灭并确认已被扑灭。

事故原因是人为错误,拆除了一个磨损的部件,并安装了错误的替换部件。更换垫片后,通常要进行泄漏测试。这次事故发生时,新的密封垫通过了泄漏测试,可能是因为测试时间很短。

事故造成的物理损坏主要集中在附近的管道和周围的隔热材料上。","None

A technician accidentally loosened critical bolts holding a fitting to the top of an H2 tank, which caused a large hydrogen leak in the dewar. The fitting contained various instruments, and upon loosening the third bolt, H2 gas exited through an opening in the seal. The Viton or neoprene O-ring was blown out of its groove and was immediately frozen, making it impossible to reseal the fitting cover. The area was evacuated, the dewar was vented and the gasket was replaced. The ullage space was not purged with helium gas during the gasket replacement, which may have been responsible for small leaks which developed during the transfer.

Cause

The fitting containing the instruments was mounted on a flange, which was in turn secured to another flange. Long bolts and short bolts were used to retain the components. The bolt heads were identical and not identified, hence leading to the error in loosening the wrong bolts. The leaks that occurred after the gasket was replaced were probably due to moisture condensation on related vent valve components.
事件简介。

一名技术人员不小心松开了固定氢气罐顶部接头的关键螺栓,导致储气罐内大量氢气泄漏。接头中装有各种仪器,松开第三个螺栓后,氢气从密封圈的开口处泄漏。氟橡胶或氯丁橡胶 O 形圈被吹出凹槽并立即冻结,导致无法重新密封接头盖。对该区域进行了排空,并对蒸馏罐进行了排气,更换了密封垫。在更换垫圈时,没有用氦气吹扫贮槽空间,这可能是在转移过程中出现小量泄漏的原因。

原因。

装有仪器的接头安装在一个法兰上,该法兰又固定在另一个法兰上。使用了长螺栓和短螺栓来固定这些部件。螺栓的头部完全相同,没有进行识别,因此导致拧松错误的螺栓。更换垫片后出现的泄漏可能是由于相关通风阀部件上的湿气凝结造成的。","None

The truck was completely totaled, but little damage was incurred by the trailer. The trailer shell was satisfactory with normal venting through the stack. The rear cabinet doors were warped shut.

Cause

	The accident occurred on a bad road, which was steep with many sharp curves. The driver was going too fast for the road conditions and the type of trailer being pulled.
	The truck driver was also used to transporting a liquid H2 trailer, which was smaller and had different weight and handling characteristics.

More importantly, per CGA S1.3, the vessel should be equipped with a dual relief system that can isolate one side from the other and allow a rupture disc to be changed without exposing the operator to hydrogen.In the second incident, the cracking of the outer mild steel vacuum jacket was more than likely related to the coefficient of thermal expansion of steel, which defines how much the material will contract when its temperature is decreased. The temperature of cryogenic liquid nitrogen is at -195.8 °C (-320.44 °F), and the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of 1020 steel at room temperature is 12 x10-6 1/0 °C. Thus, the significant contraction in the steel due to the instantaneous temperature reduction created localized stresses, which cracked under the vacuum pressure of the system. Some other method of controlling the fire should have been employed. In addition, the metal would have been made much more brittle due to the low temperature.All relevant personnel should receive at least basic training on the proper selection of fire extinguishing techniques for the given scenarios they are likely to encounter.Liquid nitrogen should not be used to put out a hydrogen fire. It is very difficult to put out a gaseous hydrogen fire, plus had the liquid nitrogen not cracked the nearby vessel's shell, it certainly could have cracked the original vessel. It could also have plugged up the stack by freezing at liquid hydrogen temperatures.
在进行可能存在氢气的机械作业时,应使用惰性气体或其他分离手段。更重要的是,根据 CGA S1. 3 的规定,容器应配备双泄压系统,该系统可将一侧与另一侧隔离,并允许在操作人员不接触氢气的情况下更换爆破片。在第二起事故中,低碳钢真空外罩的开裂很可能与钢的热膨胀系数有关,该系数决定了材料在温度降低时的收缩程度。低温液氮的温度为 -195. 8 °C（-320. 44 °F）,而 1020 钢在室温下的线性热膨胀系数为 12 x10-6 1/0 °C。因此,瞬时温度降低导致钢材大幅收缩,产生局部应力,在系统真空压力下产生裂缝。本应采用其他方法控制火势。此外,由于温度过低,金属会变得更脆。所有相关人员至少应接受基本培训,了解如何针对可能遇到的特定情况正确选择灭火技术。不应使用液氮来扑灭氢气火灾。要扑灭气态氢火灾是非常困难的,另外,如果液氮没有使附近的容器外壳破裂,它肯定会使原来的容器破裂。液氮还可能在液氢温度下冻结,堵塞烟囱。","Incident Synopsis
	While attempting to replace a rupture disk in a liquid H2 vessel, H2 gas was released and ignited. In fighting the fire, liquid N2 was sprayed onto a second liquid H2 vessel located nearby. This resulted in cracking of the outer mild steel vacuum jacket. The loss of the vacuum caused a rapid increase in pressure and rupture of the burst disk of the second vessel. H2 boiled off and was burned in the fire.

Cause
	The rupture disk was being replaced with a load of liquid H2 in the vessel and no separating inerting gas. The H2-air mixture was probably ignited by static discharges. Rupture of the second vessel burst disk was caused by the low-temperature exposure of the mild steel vacuum jacket.

	A H2 air explosion occurred near a H2 compressor, located outside. Gaseous H2 had been released from a vent stack when a relief valve was actuated. The source of ignition was not known, but considerable damage was inflicted onto the system by the ensuing fire and explosion. Following the explosion, the shut-off valves were closed and the system was vented.

Cause
	Two relief valves were located in the 3,000 psig system downstream of a 5,000/3,000 regulator. The relief valves were sized to handle substantially different flows. (One was designed for another program.) The relief valve was believed to have opened when the pressure setting was being increased from 2,700 to 2,900 psig. The accuracy of the 5,000 psig gauge used to control the dome of the 5,000/3,000 regulator control combined with the tolerance of the relief valve settings (+-3 percent) was sufficient to open the valve. Large flows were vented due to the large relief valve. In addition, the vent stack cap was designed so that the vented gases were released in a horizontal rather than vertical direction.
事件简介
位于室外的一台 H2 压缩机附近发生 H2 空气爆炸。在启动溢流阀时,气体 H2 从通风烟囱中释放出来。点火源不明,但随后发生的火灾和爆炸对系统造成了严重破坏。爆炸发生后,切断阀被关闭,系统被排空。

原因
在 5,000/3,000 调节器下游的 3,000 psig 系统中有两个泄压阀。溢流阀的大小与处理的流量大相径庭。(溢流阀被认为是在压力设置从 2,700 psig 升至 2,900 psig 时打开的。用于控制 5,000/3,000 调节器控制穹顶的 5,000 psig 压力表的精确度加上溢流阀设置的误差（+-3%）足以打开阀门。由于溢流阀较大,大量流量被排出。此外,排气烟囱盖的设计使排出的气体沿水平方向而非垂直方向释放。","None

The primary cause of this incident derives from the technician improperly performing hot work in the vicinity of a charged flammable gas line. Given the location of the flammable gas line, an alternative to performing hot work or relocating the hot work should have been considered.

Subsequently, the glove box was cleaned up by specialized hazardous materials personnel using natural bristle brushes and plastic utensils. Also, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bars were used to separate the milling balls from the powder while avoiding metal-to-metal contact.While no direct evidence has been obtained, it is possible that a small leak in the antechamber seals or back diffusion from the vacuum pump occurred to expose the NaAlH4 material to oxygen and/or water vapor. Similar sudden reactions within a glove box have been noted by other researchers working with NaAlH4 where contamination by oxygen / water vapor was suspected. A possible material mechanism is detailed in “Ashby's warning” published in Chemical and Engineering News, V47 (1), 1969. In general, researchers working with NaAlH4 or other reactive hydrogen storage materials should take extra precautions with regards to sealing and vacuum pump type/performance when holding such materials under vacuum for extended periods of time.Additional discussion about working with reactive metal-hydride materials in the laboratory can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website and in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.

	A faulty modification to a multiple-gas piping manifold allowed mixing of hydrogen and oxygen that resulted in a storage tube explosion. Several employees suffered severe burn injuries from the incident.

Incident Synopsis
	An employee, without authorization, fabricated and installed an adapter to connect a hydrogen tube trailer manifold to an oxygen tube trailer manifold at a facility for filling compressed-gas cylinders for a variety of gases, including hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and helium. A subsequent improper purging procedure allowed oxygen gas to flow into a partially filled hydrogen tube on a hydrogen tube trailer. An ignition occurred in the manifold piping system and a combustion front traveled into the hydrogen tube where, after traveling about a meter, the deflagration apparently transitioned to a detonation that ruptured the tube.

Discussion
	At the time of ignition, the composition of the gas in the tube was estimated to be about 42 vol% hydrogen with the remainder being oxygen. Although not stoichiometric, this mixture is well within the detonable range for a hydrogen-oxygen mixture. The pressure of a deflagration would not have been sufficient to rupture the tube. The initial pressure in the tube was about 4 MPa. A pressure ratio of approximately 13 can be expected for a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Thus, the maximum pressure that could have been produced in the tube by a deflagration was about 52 MPa. The tube had previously been hydrostatically tested to 90 MPa. Considering the hydrostatic test pressure, a pressure ratio in excess of 22 would have been required to rupture the tube. The close approach to a stoichiometric mixture and the high degree of confinement appears to have been sufficient to permit a transition to detonation. The far end of the tube was folded out like the petals of a flower. With the reflection of the shock wave at that point, a pressure ratio of over 40 times initial pressure would have been possible. Tube fragments (some of considerable size) were thrown a substantial distance. A 20-kg piece of the hydrogen tube was found about 425 m from the site of the explosion. The fragments did not result in any damage; however, several employees suffered severe burns.

Causes
	The immediate causes of the accident include: an unauthorized piping modification, an unapproved, improper purging procedure, and a complete disregard for applicable policies and procedures. Insufficient involvement of management in the operation of the facility was identified as a contributing factor to the incident.

Contributing Factors
	A lack of proper supervision permitted an employee to act on his own in the modification and operation of a piping system.
摘要
由于对一个多气体管道歧管进行了错误的改装,导致氢气和氧气混合,从而引发了储存管爆炸。多名员工在事故中严重烧伤。

事故概要
一名员工在未经授权的情况下,制造并安装了一个适配器,将氢气管拖车歧管连接到氧气管拖车歧管上,该设施用于充装各种气体（包括氢气,氧气,氮气和氦气）的压缩气瓶。由于随后的吹扫程序不当,氧气流入了氢气管拖车上的部分填充氢气管。在歧管管道系统中发生了点火,燃烧前沿进入氢气管,在行进了大约一米后,爆燃显然过渡到了爆炸,导致氢气管破裂。

讨论
点火时,氢气管中的气体成分估计约为 42% 的氢气,其余为氧气。虽然不是化学计量,但这种混合物完全在氢氧混合物的可引爆范围之内。爆燃的压力不足以使管道破裂。管道内的初始压力约为 4 兆帕。对于氢气和氧气的化学计量混合物,预计压力比约为 13。因此,爆燃可能在管道中产生的最大压力约为 52 兆帕。此前曾对管道进行过 90 兆帕的静水压力测试。考虑到静水压测试压力,管子破裂需要超过 22 的压力比。接近化学计量混合物和高度密闭似乎足以允许过渡到爆炸。导管的远端像花瓣一样折叠出来。由于冲击波在该点的反射,压力比可能超过初始压力的 40 倍。氢气管碎片（有些相当大）被抛出很远。在距离爆炸地点约 425 米处发现了一块 20 千克重的氢气管碎片。这些碎片没有造成任何损害,但有几名员工被严重烧伤。

事故原因
事故的直接原因包括：未经授权的管道改装,未经批准的不当清洗程序以及完全无视适用的政策和程序。管理层对设施运行的参与不足被认为是造成事故的一个因素。

促成因素
由于缺乏适当的监督,一名员工得以自行修改和操作管道系统。","None

	One man was killed and another severely injured while working with a portable battery power supply.

At a test facility, a water-submersible portable battery power supply was used to power lighting. The battery power supply contained two 12-volt lead-acid automotive batteries, a wiring harness, and switching relays mounted in an air-tight case suitable for submersion in water. The case possessed ½-inch aluminum walls and a 13.8-pound lid. The box had been used periodically over two years.

After charging all night, the battery power supply was moved into place and connected to the lighting. Two technicians started to test the unit. One technician rested his hand on the case lid while the second leaned over the lid and threw the switch to activate the system. Immediately upon throwing the switch, the box exploded, hurling the lid upward 35 feet with deadly force where it lodged, embedded 4 inches into a low-density concrete ceiling. The technician leaning over the power supply was killed instantly and the other lost the ends of his middle and index fingers of his left hand, was sprayed on the chest and face with battery acid, and suffered trauma.

Causes
	The immediate cause of the accident was procedural error. The power supply box incorporated a pipe penetration with a hand valve in the lid and a pressure gauge plumbed into the aluminum box. The protocol for charging used this equipment to vent the box and check pressurization. It was determined that the hand valve had been closed during charging, preventing venting.

The charging characteristics of lead-acid storage batteries vary with the condition of the battery and are proportional to the ampere-hour capacity of the battery. For a 100 ampere-hour 12-volt lead-acid battery, hydrogen can be evolved at a rate of several hundred standard cubic centimeters per hour both during operational and inactive periods. During charging, when a battery is close to being fully charged, hydrogen and oxygen both off gas in a flammable mixture ratio at a rate of several thousand standard cubic centimeters per hour. Therefore, without venting, the box likely possessed a near stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen which was pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. The box incorporated polarized power sockets and magnetic reed switches which were operable outside the battery box but were sealed from the interior of the box. Throwing the switch would introduce a spark within the interior of the box, readily igniting the mix. Hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen mixtures which are flammable over a broad range [4 to 94% by volume in pure oxygen] are readily ignited with a spark produced by these means.

Contributing Factors
	There were several factors contributing to the accident:

	Few of the engineers and technicians were aware of the hazards of lead-acid storage battery operation. Many were aware of the off gassing characteristic of batteries, but thought the problem was minor based on their experience with batteries in marine applications. Even a previous incident of over-pressurization that occurred with this battery box, reported and reviewed by both operations and safety personnel, did not change this outlook. Personnel lacked training.
	The design and fabrication of the power supply was not inherently safe. Automatic ventilation or inert gas purging was not incorporated into the box. Switches with arcing contacts were built into the box. It was learned afterwards through testing that it was only by chance explosions had not occurred before. Under normal conditions of use, the geometry of the box, location of the switch, and behavior of the gas mixture around the switch led to a mixture concentration above the upper flammability limit [&gt; 94 % hydrogen by volume]. With the error in procedure and formation of a flammable mixture, the arcing of the switch initiated the explosion. Finally, the aluminum box was too strong and without pressure relief. Without an overpressure failsafe incorporated into the design, the lid became a deadly projectile.
	Safety review procedures used at this facility for hazardous operations relied on the experience of the workers using the equipment and didn’t seek outside viewpoints.
事件简介
在使用便携式电池电源工作时,一人死亡,另一人重伤。

在一个试验设施中,一个水下便携式电池电源被用来为照明设备供电。电池电源包含两节 12 伏铅酸汽车电池,线束和开关继电器,安装在一个适合浸入水中的气密箱内。箱壁为 ½ 英寸铝制,箱盖重 13.8 磅。该箱已定期使用了两年多。

经过一整夜的充电,电池电源被移动到位并连接到照明设备上。两名技术人员开始测试设备。一名技术人员将手放在箱盖上,另一名技术人员俯身在箱盖上,按下开关启动系统。一按开关,箱体立即爆炸,箱盖以致命的力量向上抛出 35 英尺,嵌入低密度混凝土天花板 4 英寸处。靠在电源上方的技术人员当场死亡,另一名技术人员失去了左手的中指和食指末端,胸部和脸部被电池酸液喷到,并遭受外伤。

事故原因
事故的直接原因是程序错误。供电箱内有一个管道贯穿装置,盖子上有一个手阀,铝制箱内有一个压力表。充气协议使用该设备对箱体进行排气和加压检查。经确定,手动阀门在充电过程中被关闭,导致无法排气。

铅酸蓄电池的充电特性随蓄电池的状态而变化,并与蓄电池的安培小时容量成正比。对于 100 安培小时的 12 伏铅酸蓄电池来说,在工作和不工作期间,氢气的挥发速度都可达到每小时几百标准立方厘米。在充电过程中,当电池接近充满电时,氢气和氧气会以每小时几千标准立方厘米的速度以易燃混合物的比例释放出气体。因此,在没有通风装置的情况下,电池箱内很可能存在着氢气和氧气的近乎化学计量的混合物,其压力高于大气压。电池盒内装有极化电源插座和磁簧开关,可在电池盒外操作,但与电池盒内部密封。投掷开关会在电池盒内部产生火花,很容易点燃混合气体。氢气-空气和氢气-氧气混合物在很大范围内都是易燃的[在纯氧中为 4% 至 94% 体积],用这些方法产生的火花很容易点燃。促成因素
造成事故的因素有以下几个：.

很少有工程师和技术人员意识到铅酸蓄电池操作的危险性。许多人知道蓄电池的放气特性,但根据他们在船舶应用中使用蓄电池的经验,认为问题不大。即使之前发生过一起电池箱超压事件,并经运营和安全人员报告和审查,也没有改变这种看法。人员缺乏培训。
电源的设计和制造本身并不安全。电池箱内没有安装自动通风装置或惰性气体吹扫装置。箱内装有带电弧触点的开关。事后通过测试才知道,以前没有发生爆炸纯属偶然。在正常使用条件下,箱体的几何形状,开关的位置以及开关周围混合气体的特性都会导致混合气体的浓度超过可燃性上限 [体积分数为 94% 的氢气]。由于程序错误和易燃混合物的形成,开关的电弧引发了爆炸。最后,铝箱过于坚固且没有泄压装置。由于设计中没有过压故障保护装置,箱盖成为致命的弹丸。该工厂用于危险操作的安全审查程序依赖于使用设备的工人的经验,并不寻求外部观点。","Throwing the switch induced a spark inside the battery box

Check on a routine basis the individual cell purity levels to monitor the deterioration of performance of individual cells. Certain contaminants are produced as a result of the process that settle to the bottom of the cells. These contaminants, particularly magnetite, can block the water makeup ports and the drain valves.

A hydrogen generation plant experienced a fire and significant damage due to a concussive combustion event that started in a high-pressure hydrogen feed pipe.

System Description

A certain hydrogen plant is designed to continuously produce hydrogen at a purity of 99.75% and at a rate of 510 m3 per day. Hydrogen is produced in two banks of cells filled with a strong solution of caustic soda. Current is passed through the cells to produce hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is vented directly to the atmosphere, while the hydrogen is piped to the gasholder. The gasholder is a low-pressure storage vessel capable of storing 28 m3 of gas. It is constructed in two parts. The bottom section is a large round tank. The upper section is an inverted tank or bell that is free to move within the main tank as pressure increases or decreases. The main tank is filled with water to form a water seal. Hydrogen from the cells enters the gasholder above the water line, causing the bell to rise.

The purity of the hydrogen is monitored between the cells and the gasholder. If purity falls below 99.5%, the hydrogen is vented to the atmosphere. The plant is installed with two 100% duty compressors. Hydrogen is drawn from the gasholder by the duty compressor via the gas dryer and the filter. It is compressed to 12.4 MPa and delivered via high-pressure (HP) dryers to the storage banks. The plant contains four storage banks capable of storing 460 liters per bank. Each bank consists of 16 cylinders. Each cylinder is fitted with an overpressure protection device called a ""bursting disc"".

Details of Incident

One afternoon, an assistant operator attended the hydrogen generation plant as part of a routine plant inspection. The plant was functioning correctly and no obvious problems were noted. Approximately one hour later, a large explosion was heard by a contractor in the contractor amenities area and the remaining staff in the administration building. Calls were received soon after by the duty shift manager advising him that there was a fire at the hydrogen generation plant.

Results of Inspections

Visual inspections of the plant found the high-pressure pipe work had ruptured or parted at the following locations:

	Between two valves adjacent to a compressor
	At the pressure regulating valve near the compressor room
	Above the 'B' HP dryer
	At the inlet to the 'B' bank manifold
	At various bottle fittings in 'B' bank

In addition, the following damage was noted:

	Pipe swelling at the compressor side of the HP regulating valve
	Pipe swelling at the HP NRV (dryer side)
	Damage to a compressor blow-down pneumatic valve
	Damage to a HP dryer blow-down pneumatic valve

Twelve of the sixteen B bank cylinders and six cylinders on C bank had been affected by the heat of the fire. Many of the copper vent pipes from the cylinders to atmosphere were discolored or melted indicating that many of the cylinder bursting discs had ruptured. The vacuum and purge pipe work around B and C banks had been destroyed by the fire. The cladding at the eastern end of the building had been blown out above two storage banks. Debris from the site was distributed for 20 meters.

Conclusions

Explosions in the HP hydrogen feed pipes caused the failure of welds and connections at the storage banks, allowing hydrogen gas to be released in large quantities from the B and C storage banks. The escaping hydrogen self ignited, resulting in an explosion and fire. The cause of the initial explosions was due to the spontaneous ignition inside the HP feed pipes of an explosive mix of hydrogen and oxygen. It is concluded that the ingress of the oxygen to the system was from the hydrogen cells. The prime cause of the contamination was blockages in the water makeup lines to some cells, allowing high levels of oxygen to mix with the hydrogen as electrolyte levels fell. The low-purity hydrogen was not detected by the low-pressure purity analyzer due to the failed isolation transformer. There are a number of other potential air ingress points on the LP system that could have allowed contamination. These points are, however, considered unlikely to have been the cause of the contamination resulting in the explosion.
摘要

一家制氢工厂因高压氢气进料管道中发生的撞击燃烧事件而起火并造成重大损失。

系统描述。

某制氢厂设计为每天连续生产 510 立方米氢气,纯度为 99.75%。氢气在两组充满强碱溶液的电池中产生。电流通过电池产生氢气和氧气。氧气直接排放到大气中,而氢气则通过管道输送到储气罐。储气罐是一个低压储存容器,可储存 28 立方米的气体。它由两部分组成。底部是一个大圆罐。上部是一个倒置的罐体或钟罩,可随着压力的增减在主罐内自由移动。主水箱充满水,形成水封。电池中的氢气进入水线上方的水箱,导致钟罩上升。

氢气的纯度在电池和冲洗器之间受到监控。如果纯度低于 99.5%,则将氢气排放到大气中。设备安装有两台 100% 负载的压缩机。氢气由值班压缩机通过气体干燥器和过滤器从储气罐中抽取。氢气被压缩至 12. 4 兆帕,并通过高压 (HP) 干燥器输送到储存库。发电厂有四个储存库,每个储存库可储存 460 升水。每个储存库由 16 个气缸组成。每个气瓶都装有一个称为 ""爆破片 ""的超压保护装置。

事故详情。

一天下午,一名助理操作员到制氢装置进行例行检查。工厂运行正常,没有发现明显的问题。大约一小时后,承包商生活区的一名承包商和行政楼的其余工作人员听到了巨大的爆炸声。值班经理很快接到电话,告知制氢厂发生火灾。

检查结果。

对工厂的目视检查发现,高压管道在以下位置破裂或分离：.

压缩机附近的两个阀门之间
压缩机房附近的压力调节阀处
B' HP 干燥器上方
B' 组歧管入口处
B ""组中的多个瓶子接头处。

此外,还发现以下损坏情况：.

高压调节阀压缩机侧的管道膨胀
HP NRV（干燥机侧）管道膨胀
压缩机排气气动阀损坏
一个 HP 干燥器排气气动阀损坏。B 组 16 个气缸中的 12 个和 C 组的 6 个气缸受到大火高温的影响。许多从气缸通向大气的铜质排气管褪色或熔化,表明许多气缸爆破片已经破裂。B 库和 C 库周围的真空和吹扫管道已被大火烧毁。大楼东端两个储存库上方的包层被大火烧毁。现场的碎片分布在 20 米范围内。

结论

高压氢气供料管道的爆炸导致储存库的焊接和连接失效,使 B 和 C 储存库释放出大量氢气。逸出的氢气自燃,导致爆炸和火灾。最初爆炸的原因是氢气和氧气的爆炸性混合物在高压进料管道内自燃。结论是氧气是从氢电池进入系统的。造成污染的主要原因是某些电池的补给水管堵塞,导致电解质含量下降时高浓度的氧气与氢气混合。由于隔离变压器故障,低压纯度分析仪没有检测到低纯度的氢气。液化石油气系统上还有其他一些潜在的进气口,可能会造成污染。不过,这些点被认为不太可能是导致爆炸的污染原因。","self ignition

	An incident occurred in late 2001, while a boiling water reactor (BWR) unit was operating at rated power. The utility was performing a periodic surveillance of the high-pressure coolant-injection (HPCI) system. Immediately after the test began, the HPCI system automatically isolated and the reactor building fire detectors actuated. The unit was then manually shut down. An examination of the residual heat removal (RHR) system revealed that a pipe elbow had ruptured near the high point in the RHR branch steam supply line leading to one of the two RHR heat exchangers (steam condensing mode line) in the reactor building. Fragments from the piping rupture caused some damage to equipment in the general area, but no significant damage to any safety-related equipment. The subject line supplies steam to the RHR heat exchanger when the heat exchanger is operated in the steam condensing mode. The utility had modified the RHR piping by adding a water barrier upstream of the RHR steam supply isolation valve in order to reduce leakage through this valve.

The utility initially reported the pipe rupture as a water hammer event; however, subsequent investigation has led the utility to re-characterize the rupture as a combustion event. This re-characterization was based in part on an analysis of gases in the sister BWR unit at the same RHR piping location. This analysis found the hydrogen levels to be 46 percent by volume (percent vol), 23 percent vol oxygen, and 31 percent vol steam. A metallurgical analysis of the resulting piping fragments indicated ductile fracture from excessive internal over-pressure.

A second event occurred one month later while the unit was operating at 100-percent power. The utility interpreted a containment pressure increase, concurrent with an acoustic monitoring response, as a flange leak in the reactor head spray line. The utility uses the reactor head spray after shutdown to shorten outages. The utility isolated the drain-and-keep-fill line valve for the reactor head spray, which appeared to stop the leak. An inspection found that 2 to 3 meters (6.25 to 10 feet) in length of the 10-centimeter (about 4-inches) diameter head spray line had been destroyed; however, the effects of the ruptured piping were not reported to have caused any significant damage to any nearby safety-related equipment. Although the root cause of the pipe rupture has not yet been established, the utility is investigating the possibility of a hydrogen combustion event inside the pipe as a result of the buildup of hydrogen and oxygen gases created by radiolysis.

Discussion
	Radiolysis occurs normally in the reactor core region when radiation decomposes some reactor coolant system (RCS) water into hydrogen and oxygen. Excess hydrogen and oxygen that does not recombine into water is normally removed by the off-gas system. Hydrogen is added in those BWRs utilizing hydrogen for reactor water chemistry control in order to scavenge excess oxygen from the RCS.
	In these two foreign events, it appears that hydrogen and oxygen gases accumulated in system high points instead of being removed by the plants' off-gas system. Further, since the ignition energy for the above combustion events is predicted to be extremely small, the ignition source(s) may not be conclusively identified.
情况说明
2001 年底发生了一起事故,当时一个沸水反应堆 (BWR) 机组正在以额定功率运行。当时电力公司正在对高压冷却剂注入系统（HPCI）进行定期监测。试验开始后,高压冷却剂注入系统立即自动隔离,反应堆厂房的火灾探测器也随之启动。随后,机组被手动关闭。对余热排除（RHR）系统的检查发现,在通往反应堆厂房内两个 RHR 热交换器（蒸汽冷凝模式管线）之一的 RHR 蒸汽供应分支管线的高点附近,一个管道弯头破裂。管道破裂产生的碎片对周围的设备造成了一定程度的损坏,但没有对任何与安全相关的设备造成重大损坏。当 RHR 热交换器以蒸汽冷凝模式运行时,主题管道向热交换器供应蒸汽。公用事业公司对 RHR 管道进行了改造,在 RHR 蒸汽供应隔离阀上游加装了隔水层,以减少通过该阀门的泄漏。

电力公司最初将管道破裂报告为水锤事件,但随后的调查使电力公司将管道破裂重新定性为燃烧事件。重新定性的部分依据是对位于同一 RHR 管道位置的姊妹 BWR 机组内气体的分析。分析发现,氢气含量为 46%（体积百分比）,氧气含量为 23%（体积百分比）,蒸汽含量为 31%（体积百分比）。对由此产生的管道碎片进行的冶金分析表明,过高的内部过压造成了延展性断裂。

一个月后,当机组以 100% 功率运行时发生了第二起事故。公用事业公司将安全壳压力升高以及声学监测反应解释为反应堆顶喷管法兰泄漏。电力公司在停机后使用反应堆顶喷管来缩短停机时间。公用事业公司隔离了反应堆顶喷管的排水和补水管线阀门,这似乎阻止了泄漏。检查发现,直径为 10 厘米（约 4 英寸）的顶喷管线有 2 至 3 米（6. 25 至 10 英尺）长被毁坏；但据报告,破裂管道的影响并未对附近任何与安全相关的设备造成重大损坏。虽然管道破裂的根本原因尚未确定,但公用事业公司正在调查管道内因辐射分解产生的氢气和氧气积聚而发生氢气燃烧事件的可能性。

讨论
当辐射将反应堆冷却剂系统（RCS）的一些水分解成氢气和氧气时,反应堆堆芯区域通常会发生辐射分解。没有重新结合成水的多余氢气和氧气通常由废气系统排除。在使用氢气控制反应堆水化学的生物武器反应堆中,会加入氢气以清除反应堆堆芯中的过量氧气。
在这两起国外事件中,氢气和氧气似乎积聚在系统高点,而没有被核电厂的废气系统清除。此外,由于预测上述燃烧事件的点火能量极小,因此可能无法最终确定点火源。","None

A gas-phase explosion in a storage tower with semichemical pulp at a paper mill has possibly been caused by combustion of a mixture of hydrogen and air. The hydrogen was formed by microorganisms in the pulp. Ignition may be due to electric sparks in connection with an electric field in the mist above the pulp.

Accident Description

A gas-phase explosion took place in a 1,300 m3 storage tower for semichemical pulp at a paper mill. The storage tower was 21 m high and equipped with an agitator at the bottom. By a pumping arrangement, the pulp was circulated from the bottom to the top through external pipes connected with the mill (Fig. 1).

On a given day the production was stopped at a time when the storage tower was loaded with 1,000 m3 pulp at a temperature of 60-65°C and a pH of 5.5-6.0. Simultaneous with the production stop, the circulation pump was stopped, whereas the stirrer at the bottom remained operational. After 24 hours of down time, mill production restarted and pulp was pumped from the tower to the mill and from the bottom to the top of the tower. About three hours after production start, a violent explosion took place in the tower, blowing out the cover over the manhole and deforming the top of the tower into a spherical shape. At the moment of explosion, the tower contained approximately 600 m3 of pulp, and recordings from the load cell showed momentarily full-scale deflection. Large amounts of steam mixed with droplets of pulp were spread over a wide area. There was a distinct smell of SO2 at the top of the tower and also the smell of H2S from samples of pulp from the bottom.

Laboratory Tests

Due to the smell of SO2 and H2S at the time of explosion, it was decided to analyze pulp samples for H2S and CH4. Samples taken from the storage tower before and after the explosion were analyzed, but only traces of H2S were found. Microbiological examinations, however, showed that pulp samples from the paper mill were heavily contaminated by microorganisms. In order to check the possibility of gas formation by these organisms, a number of pulp samples from the paper mill were collected in 6L flasks equipped for gas collecting. One of the flasks was inoculated with pulp taken from the tower just before the explosion. All samples were incubated at 60°C. Within 24 hours, gas was produced in all flasks, about 300 mil in each. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry showed about half of the gas to be H2, the other half being a mixture of CO2 and N2 in equal amounts. H2S and CH4 were not detected, but analysis taken few weeks later showed small amounts of H2S (50 ppm) in the gas phase.

Discussion

This case illustrates the hazards connected with microbial gas formation under uncontrolled conditions. Thus, depending on circumstances, a storage tower for pulp may act as a fermentation tank if required precautions are not taken. Cellulose, sugars and residual pulping chemicals in the pulp may be utilized by microorganisms, the temperature of the pulp (60°C) being ideal for thermophile microorganisms having a temperature optimum between 55 and 75 °C. The extent of microbial growth will depend on the microbial contamination as well as type and condition of the pulp. Under anaerobic conditions, the microorganisms get their energy by fermentation, and H2 is one of the products that could be formed. Indeed H2 is produced under a wide variety of anaerobic conditions and is usually utilized by other microorganisms, yielding other products like CH4 and H2S.

The laboratory tests and analysis indicated that H2 had been the main combustible gas produced by microbial activity. In this case, it is not likely that the H2 produced in the pulp was utilized by methane-producing bacteria. The tests also indicated that only small amounts of H2S had been produced. The smell of H2S and SO2 previously referred to may be explained by the fact that these gases are smelled at very low concentrations.

During the plant stop, some of the gas may have been entrapped in the pulp (4 percent fiber content) until circulation started. By pumping the pulp to the paper machine, air was sucked into the tower and mixed with the gases. H2 and H2S, being combustible and explosive gases in mixtures with oxygen or air within wide limits, may have caused the explosion by ignition.

As ignition of the gas mixture could not be explained by open fire or electrical installation, it was assumed that electric sparks in connection with an electric field in the mist above the pulp had caused the explosion. It is well known that electric charges bound to a mist of tiny water drops accumulate in cargo tanks of oil tankers cleaned with water jets, and that electric sparks caused by these charges may ignite explosive mixtures in the tanks. Electric charges of the same density (-15 to -18 nC/m3) as found in crude oil tankers, have later been measured in the storage tower during normal production at the paper mill. The ignition energy for mixtures of air and H2 is only 1/20 of the energy required for ignition of vapor from crude oil.
摘要

一家造纸厂装有半化学纸浆的储存塔中发生的气相爆炸可能是由氢气和空气的混合物燃烧引起的。氢是由纸浆中的微生物形成的。点火原因可能是纸浆上方雾气中的电场产生了电火花。

事故描述

一家造纸厂的 1,300 立方米半化学纸浆储存塔发生气相爆炸。储存塔高 21 米,底部装有搅拌器。通过泵送装置,纸浆通过与造纸厂相连的外部管道从底部循环到顶部（图 1）。

在某一天,当储存塔装满 1000 立方米的纸浆,温度为 60-65°C,pH 值为 5. 5-6. 在停产的同时,循环泵也停止了运转,但底部的搅拌器仍在运行。停机 24 小时后,纸浆厂重新开始生产,纸浆从塔内泵送到纸浆厂,又从塔底泵送到塔顶。生产开始约三小时后,塔内发生剧烈爆炸,炸掉了人孔的盖子,塔顶变形为球形。爆炸发生时,塔内装有约 600 立方米的纸浆,称重传感器的记录显示塔体瞬间发生了全面变形。大量蒸汽混合着纸浆液滴散布在很大范围内。塔顶有明显的二氧化硫气味,塔底的纸浆样本也有 H2S 的气味。

实验室测试。

由于爆炸时有 SO2 和 H2S 的气味,因此决定对纸浆样本进行 H2S 和 CH4 分析。对爆炸前后从储藏塔中提取的样本进行了分析,但只发现了微量的 H2S。然而,微生物检查显示,造纸厂的纸浆样本受到了微生物的严重污染。为了检测这些微生物形成气体的可能性,我们从造纸厂收集了一些纸浆样本,并将其放入装有气体收集装置的 6 升烧瓶中。其中一个烧瓶接种了爆炸前从塔中提取的纸浆。所有样品均在 60°C 下培养。24 小时内,所有烧瓶中都产生了气体,每个烧瓶中约有 300 mil。气相色谱法和质谱法显示,大约一半的气体是 H2,另一半是等量的 CO2 和 N2 的混合物。没有检测到 H2S 和 CH4,但几周后进行的分析显示气相中有少量 H2S（50 ppm）。

讨论。这一案例说明了在不受控制的条件下微生物气体形成的危害。因此,根据具体情况,如果不采取必要的预防措施,纸浆储存塔可能会成为发酵罐。纸浆中的纤维素,糖和残留的制浆化学品可被微生物利用,纸浆的温度（60°C）非常适合嗜热微生物,其最适温度在 55 至 75°C 之间。微生物生长的程度取决于微生物污染以及纸浆的类型和条件。在厌氧条件下,微生物通过发酵获得能量,而 H2 是可能形成的产物之一。事实上,在各种厌氧条件下都会产生 H2,而且通常会被其他微生物利用,产生 CH4 和 H2S 等其他产物。

实验室测试和分析表明,H2 是微生物活动产生的主要可燃气体。在这种情况下,纸浆中产生的 H2 不可能被产甲烷细菌利用。检测结果还表明,只产生了少量的 H2S。前面提到的 H2S 和 SO2 的气味可能是由于这些气体的浓度很低。在工厂停工期间,部分气体可能被夹杂在纸浆中（纤维含量为 4%）,直到循环开始。通过将纸浆泵送到造纸机,空气被吸入塔中并与气体混合。H2 和 H2S 是易燃易爆气体,与氧气或空气的混合物在很大范围内都可能通过点火引起爆炸。

由于气体混合物的点燃无法用明火或电气装置来解释,因此假定纸浆上方的雾气中与电场有关的电火花引起了爆炸。众所周知,在用喷水装置清洗过的油轮货舱中,由微小水滴组成的水雾会积聚电荷,这些电荷产生的电火花可能会点燃货舱中的爆炸性混合物。后来,在造纸厂的正常生产过程中,也曾在贮存塔中测量到与原油油轮中相同密度（-15 至 -18 nC/m3）的电荷。空气和 H2 混合物的点火能量仅为原油蒸汽点火所需能量的 1/20。","None

检查期间","The lessons of this event fall into five categories: (1) proper in-plant communications during events, (2) proper valve application for use with hydrogen, (3) excess flow check valve set point, (4) heating and ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) maintenance and flow testing, and (5) hydrogen line routing. The operator is examining ways to improve communications in the plant during events and the training of personnel in reading portable instruments.As another corrective measure, the operator is examining the use of other types of valves, such as valves with a diaphragm or bellows rather than conventional stem packing, in lines containing hydrogen. The operator is also examining the set point for the excess flow check valves on the hydrogen lines. These check valves are designed to limit the flow of hydrogen in the event of a large leak so that when combined with proper ventilation in rooms with hydrogen lines, hydrogen levels would remain within specified limits throughout the plant.This plant had HVAC flow balancing problems during the preparation for plant startup. Generally HVAC flow balance is based on the heat loads and the resultant room temperatures under normal and accident conditions. However, this event demonstrates that hydrogen concentrations also may need to be considered to set a lower limit on the ventilation in rooms that contain hydrogen lines.
这次事件的教训分为五类：(1) 事件发生时工厂内的正确沟通,(2) 氢气使用时阀门的正确应用,(3) 过量流量止回阀的设定点,(4) 暖通空调 (HVAC) 的维护和流量测试,以及 (5) 氢气管线的路由。运营方正在研究如何改善活动期间工厂内的通讯,并对人员进行读取便携式仪器的培训。作为另一项纠正措施,运营商正在研究在含氢管线中使用其他类型的阀门,如带有隔膜或波纹管而非传统阀杆填料的阀门。操作员还在检查氢气管道上过量流量止回阀的设定点。这些止回阀的设计目的是在发生大量泄漏时限制氢气的流量,以便在有氢气管道的房间内进行适当的通风,使整个工厂的氢气含量保持在规定的范围内。该工厂在准备启动过程中遇到了暖通空调流量平衡问题。一般来说,暖通空调流量平衡是基于正常和事故条件下的热负荷和由此产生的室内温度。但这一事件表明,氢气浓度也可能需要考虑在内有氢气管线的房间内设置通风下限。","A power plant reported a hydrogen leak inside an auxiliary building. The given plant was in cold shutdown at the time of the event. The discovery of this problem was as a result of an unassociated event involving the activation of a chlorine monitor in the control building. When additional samples indicated no chlorine gas, the shift supervisor ordered further investigation into other plant areas. Because there was no installed detection equipment, portable survey instruments were used to determine gaseous mixtures. Hydrogen was detected in the auxiliary building at 20 to 30 percent of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for hydrogen. A level of about 30 percent of LFL corresponds to about 1.2 percent hydrogen by volume.

When hydrogen was discovered in the auxiliary building, the operator isolated the cryogenic hydrogen skid outside the turbine building and soon located the source of the leak as packing on a globe valve in a small line to the volume control tank (VCT). The operator opened doors that quickly caused the hydrogen to dissipate. The globe valve was of a conventional design and had no special packing. The globe valve was located in a vertical pipe chase where little ventilation was present because of ongoing HVAC testing. Besides being used as a cover gas in the VCT, hydrogen from the skid is used to cool the generator.
一家发电厂报告称,辅助建筑内发生氢气泄漏。事件发生时,发电厂处于冷停机状态。发现这一问题的原因是控制楼内的氯气监测器被激活。当更多的样本显示没有氯气时,当班主管下令进一步调查其他工厂区域。由于没有安装检测设备,因此使用便携式调查仪器来确定气体混合物。在辅助楼中检测到的氢气含量为氢气可燃性下限 (LFL) 的 20% 至 30%。约 30% 的可燃性下限相当于约 1.2% 的氢气（按体积计算）。

当发现辅助楼内有氢气时,操作员将低温氢气橇隔离在涡轮机楼外,并很快找到了泄漏源,即通向容积控制罐 (VCT) 的一条小管线上的截止阀填料。操作员打开了门,使氢气迅速消散。该截止阀采用传统设计,没有特殊的填料。由于正在进行暖通空调（HVAC）测试,截止阀位于垂直管道中,通风条件很差。除了用作 VCT 的掩护气体外,滑橇中的氢气还用于冷却发电机。","None

The continuous analyzer should be interlocked to shut the electrolyzer down when product purity falls below some nominally critical values. This incident, illustrates the need for more widespread use of hydrogen analyzers, and the inverse relationship between hydrogen accidents and regular maintenance.
调查报告指出,通过对氧气和氢气产品纯度进行连续气体分析仪测试等措施,本可以防止爆炸的发生。当产品纯度低于某些名义上的临界值时,连续分析仪应联锁关闭电解槽。这起事故说明需要更广泛地使用氢气分析仪,以及氢气事故与定期维护之间的反比关系。","An explosion occurred in an electrolysis system in a commercial facility. Electrolysis of a potassium hydroxide solution is used to produce hydrogen for a hydrogenation processes. The circular electrolysis cells are 1.5 m in diameter and 25 mm thick. Design current for the electrolyzer is 6,000 amps at 1.78 volts. Operating temperature and pressure is 70-90 °C and 435 psig. Hydrogen and oxygen product gases are separated from the electrolyte in separating drums. The system had been operating at the plant for 13 years prior to the explosion. Operating experiences had been generally favorable except for the need to periodically flush the system with water to remove sludge formations.

According to the investigative report, sludge deposits in the electrolyte passages started the following sequence of events, culminating in the explosion.

Reduced electrolyte flow rates caused by sludge blockage resulted in increased cell temperatures and electrolyte concentrations. The increased electrolyte concentrations and linear velocities (due to obstructed passages) eventually led to severe corrosion/erosion damage of the cell electrodes and separators (hydrogen embrittlement may have also been a contributing factor). Physical breakdown of the cell separators allowed hydrogen and oxygen to mix and hydrogen to enter the oxygen separator drum. The gas mixture was ignited causing a violent explosion which ruptured the separator drum. A plant operator in the electrolysis room at the time of the explosion was fatally burned by the caustic solution sprayed from the ruptured drum.

根据调查报告,电解液通道中的污泥沉积引发了以下一系列事件,最终导致了爆炸。

污泥堵塞造成电解液流速降低,导致电池温度和电解液浓度升高。由于通道受阻,电解液浓度和线速度增加,最终导致电池电极和分离器严重腐蚀/侵蚀损坏（氢脆可能也是一个因素）。电池分离器的物理损坏使得氢气和氧气混合,氢气进入氧气分离器鼓。气体混合物被点燃,引起剧烈爆炸,分离器滚筒破裂。爆炸发生时,电解室中的一名工厂操作员被从破裂的滚筒中喷出的腐蚀性溶液烧死。","None

Great care should be taken to ensure that the ventilation system is operational and brings in enough outdoor air to properly ventilate the enclosure.Electrical safety interlocks should also be considered, which would isolate the batteries from their power supply, not allowing the batteries to charge if the ventilation system isn't working properly.It is imperative that the battery room designers pay close attention to the design of ventilation systems and electrical safety interlocks. There are lots of good (and bad) ways to design and install battery rooms and critical ventilation systems. If designers do not have experience designing UPS battery rooms, experienced consultants should be contacted to ensure a safe and effective design.In addition, internal management procedures need to be developed which analyze operation of such systems. As in this case, the entire data center was removed and the UPS system was no longer needed. The UPS system should have been decommissioned when the data center was removed. A good management-of-change procedure would have uncovered this problem before it became an incident.More information on management of change can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner and also in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
要告诉大家的是,UPS 电池室的通风至关重要。应格外注意确保通风系统正常运行,并引入足够的室外空气,使机柜适当通风。还应考虑电气安全联锁,将电池与电源隔离,如果通风系统不能正常工作,就不允许电池充电。电池室设计人员必须密切关注通风系统和电气安全联锁的设计。设计和安装电池室和关键通风系统有很多好（和坏）的方法。如果设计人员没有设计不间断电源电池室的经验,应联系有经验的顾问,以确保设计安全有效。此外,还需要制定内部管理程序,对此类系统的运行进行分析。在本案例中,整个数据中心被拆除,不再需要 UPS 系统。在拆除数据中心时,UPS 系统本应退役。一个好的变更管理程序本可以在事故发生之前发现这个问题。有关变更管理的更多信息,请参阅 ""经验教训 ""角和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A hydrogen explosion occurred in an Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) battery room. The explosion blew a 400 ft2 hole in the roof, collapsed numerous walls and ceilings throughout the building, and significantly damaged a large portion of the 50,000 ft2 building. Fortunately, the computer/data center was vacant at the time and there were no injuries.

The facility was formerly a large computer/data center with a battery room and emergency generators. The company vacated the building and moved out the computer equipment; however the battery back-up system was left behind. The ventilation for the battery room appeared to be tied into a hydrogen monitoring system. The hydrogen sensor was in alarm upon emergency responders arriving at the scene (post-explosion). 911 callers reporting the explosion also reported hearing an alarm for 3 days prior to the explosion. This appears to have been a local alarm, as it was not relayed at any time to the local fire department. Given how slowly batteries generate H2 (1.3x10-7m/s per amp-cell), it appears as though batteries were charging for a long period of time with no ventilation. Apparently the detector was alarming, and hydrogen continued to build up until it found an ignition source. Due to the damage and actions of emergency responders shutting off all circuit breakers, etc., it could not be verified whether the ventilation system failed, or was previously turned off when the building was vacated. Onsite personnel assumed that the ignition occurred at or near a grounding strap on the battery racks, but in a room full of batteries and electrical equipment, ignition sources are plentiful.

该设施以前是一个大型计算机/数据中心,配有电池室和应急发电机。该公司腾空了大楼,搬走了计算机设备,但留下了备用电池系统。电池室的通风系统似乎与氢气监控系统相连。应急人员到达现场时（爆炸发生后）,氢气传感器处于报警状态。报告爆炸事件的 911 报警电话也称在爆炸前 3 天听到了警报声。这似乎是一个本地警报,因为它在任何时候都没有转发给当地消防部门。鉴于电池产生 H2 的速度很慢（每安培电池 1.3x10-7m/s）,电池似乎在没有通风的情况下长时间充电。显然,探测器发出了警报,氢气继续积聚,直到找到火源。由于损坏和紧急救援人员关闭了所有断路器等。此外,无法核实通风系统是否发生故障,或在大楼腾空时被关闭。现场人员推测着火点发生在电池架上的接地带处或附近,但在一个堆满电池和电气设备的房间里,着火源非常多。","None

The strategy of using liquid sodium hypochlorite for disinfecting water instead of gaseous chlorine (CL2) is popular because the liquid is generally safer and falls under fewer OSHA and EPA standards. The further idea of generating the liquid sodium hypochlorite on an as-needed basis and in limited quantities also has certain obvious safety advantages.

One of the disadvantages of the electrolytic process is that hydrogen gas is also created as a byproduct. The hydrogen is supposed to be vented, by design, to the atmosphere before the liquid sodium hypochlorite passes into a holding tank.

For various reasons, in this instance it is believed that the hydrogen vent line was closed, thereby forcing the hydrogen gas into the liquid holding tank where it accumulated. In order to repair a leak in the tank, plant workers had drained the tank to within a few inches and then lowered an electric pump into the tank to remove the remaining liquid. When the switch was thrown to turn on the pump, the tank exploded. One worker was killed by the blast.
一家水处理厂使用电解工艺从氯化钠（NaCl）中生成次氯酸钠（NaOCl）。使用液态次氯酸钠而不是气态氯（CL2）对水进行消毒的策略很受欢迎,因为液态次氯酸钠通常更安全,而且符合 OSHA 和 EPA 标准的情况较少。此外,根据需要生成液态次氯酸钠且数量有限的想法也具有某些明显的安全优势。

电解过程的缺点之一是会产生氢气作为副产品。按照设计,氢气应该在液态次氯酸钠进入储罐之前排入大气。

由于种种原因,在这种情况下,据信氢气排放管被关闭,从而迫使氢气进入储液罐,并在那里积聚。为了修复储液罐中的泄漏,工厂工人将储液罐中的液体抽干到几英寸的范围内,然后将电动泵放入储液罐中清除剩余的液体。当打开泵的开关时,储罐发生了爆炸。一名工人被炸死。","None

Based on the information received, the vendor was not completely informed via the purchase specifications regarding the service condition to which the valve would be exposed. Further, all users of these valves were not notified of the initial problem through either oversight by the vendor or as a result of the valves being supplied through an intermediate source. To avoid similar incidents in the future, onsite personnel need to ensure that their vendors receive comprehensive specifications relating to the application, use and service conditions associated with all of the stainless steel valves implemented in applications susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement.A web-based resource developed by Sandia National Laboratories to provide data on hydrogen embrittlement of various materials is available at Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials.
上述事件表明可能存在许可证/供应商接口问题。根据收到的信息,供应商并没有通过采购规格完全了解阀门将面临的服务条件。此外,由于供应商的疏忽,或者由于阀门是通过中间渠道供应的,这些阀门的所有用户都没有被告知最初的问题。为避免今后发生类似事件,现场人员需要确保其供应商收到与所有易发生氢脆的不锈钢阀门的应用,使用和服务条件相关的全面规范。桑迪亚国家实验室开发了一个网络资源,提供各种材料的氢脆数据,请访问材料氢兼容性技术参考。","Difficulties were experienced with two solenoid-operated globe valves in a charging system. When shut, the valves could not be reopened without securing all charging pumps. During a refueling outage, the two valves were disassembled and examined to determine the cause of the malfunction. It was found that disc guide assembly springs in both valves had undergone complete catastrophic failure. The springs, which initially had 25 coils, were found in sections of only 1-2 coils. Metallurgical analysis of the failed springs attributed the probable cause of failure was due to hydrogen embrittlement. The springs are made of 17-7 PH stainless steel.

Discussion with the valve manufacturer revealed that similar failures occurred on three previous occasions. These spring failures were also attributed to hydrogen embrittlement.

检查期间","The hydrogen facility does not meet industrial guidelines for facilities of this type, from the standpoint of (1) the separation distance needed between a hydrogen pipe break and the building ventilation intake to prevent buildup of a flammable or explosive gas mixture inside the enclosure, and (2) the separation distance needed to prevent damage to safety-related structures resulting from the explosion of an 8,000-scf hydrogen tank.Safety concerns such as hydrogen leaks and storage tank detonations must be considered and used to create effective new construction designs which mitigate the consequences of such events. Existing buildings which house hydrogen storage tanks need to properly analyze all of the risks associated with the use and storage of such systems.
从以下角度来看,该氢气设施不符合此类设施的工业准则：(1) 氢气管道破裂与建筑物通风口之间为防止易燃或易爆气体混合物在围墙内积聚所需的隔离距离；(2) 为防止 8,000 立方英尺氢气罐爆炸对安全相关结构造成破坏所需的隔离距离。必须考虑氢气泄漏和储氢罐爆炸等安全问题,并利用这些问题设计出有效的新建筑,以减轻此类事件的后果。存放氢气储存罐的现有建筑物需要适当分析与使用和储存此类系统相关的所有风险。","During an inspection, three potential safety problems were identified concerning the location of a hydrogen storage facility. The hydrogen storage facility is located on a building's roof, which is made of 30-inch-thick reinforced concrete. The following potential safety problems were identified during the inspection:

	Leakage of hydrogen gas from the storage facility in proximity to the air intakes of the building's ventilation system may introduce a flammable or explosive gas mixture into the enclosure. Because the hydrogen storage facility, containing four 8,000-scf hydrogen tanks at up to 2,450 psig, is Seismic Category II, a seismic event may result in a hydrogen leak. Furthermore, the pressure relief valves in the hydrogen facility exhaust downward to within 6 inches of the roof in the vicinity of the ventilation system air intakes. It was also noted that six 8,000-scf nitrogen tanks were located in the vicinity of the building's air intakes. Nitrogen leakage and dispersion into the air intakes may lead to incapacitation of the occupants.
	A detonation of a hydrogen storage tank may structurally damage and affect performance of safety-related equipment on the building's roof, such as the ventilation system intake and exhaust structure, the emergency pressurization system, and equipment in the building itself.
	An explosion of the hydrogen delivery truck that provides hydrogen to the facility through a fill line located at ground level on the wall of the auxiliary building may structurally damage safety-related component cooling water pumps located inside the auxiliary building and in the vicinity of the hydrogen fill line.
在一次检查中,发现了有关氢气储存设施位置的三个潜在安全问题。氢气储存设施位于一栋建筑的屋顶上,屋顶由 30 英寸厚的钢筋混凝土制成。检查中发现了以下潜在的安全问题：.

氢气从靠近大楼通风系统进气口的储氢设施中泄漏,可能会将易燃易爆气体混合物带入围墙内。由于氢气储存设施包含四个 8,000 立方英尺的氢气罐,压力高达 2,450 psig,属于地震二级,地震事件可能导致氢气泄漏。此外,氢气设施中的泄压阀向下排气至通风系统进气口附近距离屋顶 6 英寸的范围内。还注意到,在大楼进气口附近有六个 8,000 立方英尺的氮气罐。氮气泄漏并扩散到进气口可能会导致居住者丧失能力。
氢气储罐的爆炸可能会对建筑物屋顶上与安全相关的设备造成结构性损坏并影响其性能,例如通风系统的进气口和排气口结构,紧急加压系统以及建筑物本身的设备。氢气输送车通过辅助楼墙壁上位于地面的加注管线向设施提供氢气,如果氢气输送车发生爆炸,可能会对辅助楼内和氢气加注管线附近与安全相关的组件冷却水泵造成结构性损坏。","None

维护期间","This incident illustrates how difficult it is to completely purge hydrogen out of a large, complex piece of equipment. Uniform mixing and dilution is unlikely in all the partially enclosed spaces, crevices, etc. If a hazardous operation such as welding must be performed with an air atmosphere (instead of inert gas) in the equipment, reliable gas concentration measurements should be obtained at several different locations. In the case of the generator, a direct measurement of hydrogen concentration may well have been more reliable than the 100 percent CO2 reading on the densitometer. Furthermore, the gas composition should have been determined at the welding site as well as the top of the generator.The importance of purging hydrogen piping and equipment is discussed in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website.
这一事件说明,要完全清除大型复杂设备中的氢气是多么困难。在所有部分封闭的空间,缝隙等处都不可能实现均匀混合和稀释。如果必须在空气环境（而不是惰性气体）下进行焊接等危险操作,则应在多个不同位置进行可靠的气体浓度测量。就发生器而言,直接测量氢气浓度可能比密度计上 100% 的二氧化碳读数更可靠。此外,还应在焊接地点和发生器顶部测定气体成分。本网站的 ""经验教训 ""角讨论了氢气管道和设备吹扫的重要性。","A large, hydrogen-cooled generator is driven by steam turbines at a power station. During maintenance shutdowns, the hydrogen cooling loop in the generator is purged with carbon dioxide. After CO2 concentrations are measured with a densitometer to verify the complete removal of hydrogen, the generator is purged with air and the maintenance is performed.

This purging procedure was used prior to the explosion. The CO2 reading was reported to be 100 percent CO2 at the top of the generator. The cooling system was then purged with air and a 1/2 inch pipe in the cooling loop was cut to install some new instrumentation. When the pipe was cut, pressurized gas was emitted at the opening. Workers assumed the gas was either carbon dioxide or air and proceeded with the new instrument installation. Unfortunately, there was still at least some hydrogen in the pipe and the rest of the cooling loop. When the welder struck an arc, a flame developed at the pipe opening and flashed back into the generator. This caused a low-level explosion within the generator shroud. The explosion damaged ventilation baffle plates and auxiliary equipment in the generator, which caused the plant to be out of service for 26 days.
大型氢冷发电机由发电站的蒸汽轮机驱动。在停机维护期间,发电机的氢气冷却回路会被二氧化碳吹扫。用密度计测量二氧化碳浓度以确认氢气已完全清除后,用空气吹扫发电机并进行维护。

在爆炸发生之前,就已经使用了这种吹扫程序。据报告,发生器顶部的二氧化碳读数为 100%。随后对冷却系统进行了空气吹扫,并切割了冷却回路中的一根 1/2 英寸管道,以安装一些新的仪器。当管道被切断时,开口处释放出加压气体。工人们认为这些气体不是二氧化碳就是空气,于是继续安装新仪器。不幸的是,管道和冷却回路的其他部分至少还存在一些氢气。当电焊工打出电弧时,管道口产生了火焰,并闪回发电机。这引起了发电机护罩内的低空爆炸。爆炸损坏了发电机内的通风挡板和辅助设备,导致发电厂停运 26 天。","None

从这起事故中得到的一个重要教训是,必须对高压工艺设备的所有维修和改装进行仔细的工程设计和测试。","A rupture occurred in a 24-inch gas line in a reformer. The pipe contained hydrogen and carbon monoxide at a pressure of about 400 psi and a temperature of 930 °C. The ruptured section of pipe had a high-temperature alloy steel outer wall, a refractory liner, and a stainless steel inner liner. The refractory lining had been repaired several times before (including three months prior to the incident) because of localized deterioration and hot spots. The repair procedure consisted of cutting a section of pipe, re-pouring the refractory liner, and patch-welding the outer wall.

The first rupture occurred when the 42-inch-long welded section of the pipe suddenly blew out. On-site employees heard a rumble and observed a flame above the ruptured pipe. Before the torch fire at the rupture site could be extinguished, it eroded the refractory lining in the secondary reformer and most of the remaining pipe. Instrumentation in the secondary reformer was damaged as was piping and vessel insulation in the vicinity of the rupture. The expansion loop between the primary and secondary reformers dropped about 1 inch and cracks were found in two ells on the loop.

After three weeks of repairs, the plant was brought up to production temperature and pressure again. Employees taking readings after startup noticed a flame coming from the same gas line that had just been repaired. When the reformers were shut down, the flame was extinguished, and a 10-inch crack was discovered in the inside radius of an ell in the expansion loop. The ell had apparently cracked on startup and allowed the gas to escape and auto-ignite. The fracture was apparently caused by excess stress on the ell as a result of the 1-inch displacement of the expansion loop during the first incident.
重整器中的一条 24 英寸气体管道发生破裂。管道中含有氢气和一氧化碳,压力约为 400 psi,温度为 930 °C。破裂的管段有高温合金钢外壁,耐火衬里和不锈钢内衬。由于出现局部老化和热点,耐火内衬曾多次修复（包括事故发生前三个月）。修复过程包括切割一段管道,重新浇注耐火衬里和外壁补焊。

第一次破裂发生时,42 英寸长的焊接管段突然爆裂。现场员工听到隆隆声,并观察到破裂管道上方有火焰。破裂处的喷灯火焰还未熄灭,就已经烧毁了二级转化炉的耐火衬里和大部分剩余管道。二级转化炉中的仪表以及破裂处附近的管道和容器隔热材料均遭到损坏。一级转化炉和二级转化炉之间的膨胀回路下降了约 1 英寸,并在回路的两个椭圆上发现了裂缝。

经过三周的维修,装置再次达到生产温度和压力。启动后进行读数的员工发现,刚刚维修过的同一条气体管线上冒出了火焰。重整器关闭后,火焰熄灭,在膨胀回路的一个椭圆内半径上发现了一条 10 英寸长的裂缝。显然,该椭圆在启动时就已破裂,导致气体泄漏和自动点火。裂缝显然是由于在第一次事故中膨胀回路发生了 1 英寸的位移,导致椭圆上的应力过大而造成的。","Auto-ignition

这一事件说明,看似 ""相当小 ""的氢火实际上可能只是更大火灾中的可见部分。仅靠观察并不是检测纯氢火灾和/或评估其严重程度的可靠技术。","An industrial heater used to heat a naphtha-hydrogen mixture developed a small leak in one of its finned tubes. The leak resulted in a 2-ft long torch flame, which was eventually noticed by an employee. Upon discovering the fire, the hydrotreater was shut down by cutting off the flow of naphtha and the flow of fuel to the burners in the heater. The hydrogen flow was maintained in order to cool and sweep the reactor during the shutdown operation.

The torch flame appeared to diminish significantly while only the hydrogen was flowing. However, molten metal dripping from the heater indicated that a much more severe fire was still in progress. The fire was eventually controlled by reducing the hydrogen flow and injecting steam into the heater. Inspection of the damaged heater revealed that the fire had completely melted 12-ft long sections of 32 finned tubes.

当只有氢气流动时,火炬火焰似乎明显减弱。然而,从加热器滴出的熔融金属表明,一场更为严重的火灾仍在继续。通过减少氢气流量并向加热器注入蒸汽,火势最终得到控制。对损坏的加热器进行检查后发现,大火已将 32 根翅片管中 12 英尺长的部分完全融化。","Burners in the industrial heater

如上文讨论的火灾所示,缺乏对这些设施的适当维护,系统监控和维护监督,可能会导致难以扑灭的火灾,并对消防人员造成极大的危险。对储氢设施设备进行适当的维护,监控和监督可以最大程度地降低火灾或爆炸的风险。","A fire occurred in a hydrogen storage facility. The fire was reported by an employee who saw the fire start after he had aligned valves at the hydrogen storage facility in preparation for putting the hydrogen injection system into service. The employee escaped injury because he was wearing fire-retardant protective clothing and was able to quickly scale a 7-foot-high fence enclosing the hydrogen area. The local fire brigade was dispatched and offsite fire fighting assistance was requested. Upon reaching the scene, the local fire department reported seeing a large hydrogen-fueled fire in the vicinity of the hydrogen tube trailer unit. The heat of the fire potentially endangered the nearby hydrogen storage tanks. The onsite fire department, with offsite fire fighting support, fought the fire until the hydrogen supply was exhausted and the fire was declared out approximately six hours later.

The company identified the root cause as organizational and programmatic deficiencies that resulted in multiple component failures. The hydrogen control panel and associated equipment are vendor-supplied and maintained. The licensee determined that the vendor maintenance program and oversight of that program were inadequate. In addition, the site identified recurring problems with the system that had not been effectively resolved.

Analysis
	An investigative committee performed a special inspection of the facility. The results of the inspection determined that the company’s overall response to the event was acceptable. The company and offsite support took appropriate actions to control the fire until the hydrogen burned out. The special investigation also determined that the company’s subsequent event investigation was systematic and comprehensive.

The company identified the lack of effective maintenance as a root cause of the hydrogen fire event at the facility. Three valves failed, starting the fire. According to the root cause evaluation, all of the failures were due to an inadequate preventive maintenance program by the hydrogen system vendor and inadequate system monitoring and management oversight by the facility.
氢气储存设施发生火灾。火灾是由一名员工报告的,他在氢气储存设施对准阀门,准备将氢气喷射系统投入使用后看到起火。由于该员工当时穿着阻燃防护服,并能迅速翻越围住氢气区的 7 英尺高的围栏,因此躲过一劫。当地消防队出动,并请求场外消防援助。到达现场后,当地消防队报告说,在氢气管拖车装置附近看到了以氢气为燃料的大火。大火的高温可能会危及附近的氢气储罐。现场消防队在场外消防支持下进行了扑救,直到氢气供应耗尽,大约六小时后宣布火势扑灭。

该公司查明,根本原因是组织和程序上的缺陷导致多个组件失效。氢气控制面板和相关设备由供应商提供和维护。许可证持有者认为,供应商维护计划和对该计划的监督不足。此外,现场还发现该系统经常出现问题,但没有得到有效解决。分析
调查委员会对设施进行了一次特别检查。检查结果表明,公司对事件的整体反应是可以接受的。公司和场外支持部门采取了适当的行动来控制火势,直到氢气燃烧殆尽。特别调查还确定,该公司随后进行的事件调查是系统和全面的。

该公司确认,缺乏有效的维护是该设施氢气起火事件的根本原因。三个阀门发生故障,引发了火灾。根据根本原因评估,所有故障都是由于氢气系统供应商的预防性维护计划不充分以及工厂的系统监控和管理监督不充分造成的。","None

无论如何,从这一事件中应该吸取的教训是,如果在隔膜上使用惰性气体而不是空气,或者监测上半球的氢气浓度,爆炸是可以避免的。","Hydrogen was stored in a plant in a 42 ½ ft diameter sphere made of 3/16 inch steel. The sphere was partitioned into two hemispheres by a neoprene diaphragm attached around the equator. Hydrogen was stored under the diaphragm, while the upper hemisphere contained air. An explosion-proof fan was situated in the upper portion of the sphere in order to provide a slight positive pressure on the top of the diaphragm.

When the plant was shut down for a local holiday, the fan on top of the hydrogen sphere was also stopped. During plant startup two days later, a violent explosion occurred in the sphere. The sphere shell was torn into many sections by the explosion, and some of the sections were propelled as far as 1,200 ft. Some of these sections struck flammable liquid storage tanks and cracked the roofs of adjacent buildings. Most of the windows in the surrounding buildings were broken by the blast wave. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries.

A loss investigation indicated that hydrogen had leaked past the diaphragm when the fan was shut down. (The diaphragm had been installed about a year before the explosion as a replacement for another leaky diaphragm.*) Ignition of the resulting hydrogen-air mixture was attributed to an electrostatic discharge caused by the motion of the diaphragm when a compressor was started downstream of the sphere. However, another possible ignition source was the 'explosion-proof' fan at the top of the sphere.

*Hydrogen leaks across the diaphragm may have been due to the hydrogen permeability of neoprene. Measurements of hydrogen and oxygen diffusion through neoprene and other synthetic rubber skins have indicated this is the primary cause of a series of hydrogen-filled balloon explosions in Germany.
氢气被储存在一个用 3/16 英寸钢材制成的直径 42 ½ 英尺的球体中。球体被一个连接在赤道周围的氯丁橡胶隔膜分成两个半球。氢气储存在隔膜下面,上半球则装有空气。球体上部装有一个防爆风扇,为隔膜顶部提供轻微的正压。

当工厂因当地假期而关闭时,氢气球顶部的风扇也停止了运转。两天后,在工厂启动时,氢球发生了剧烈爆炸。一些部分击中了易燃液体储罐,并使邻近建筑物的屋顶破裂。周围建筑物的大部分窗户都被冲击波击碎。幸运的是,没有造成严重的人员伤亡。

损失调查表明,当风机关闭时,氢气从隔膜处泄漏。(该隔膜是在爆炸发生前一年安装的,用于替换另一个泄漏的隔膜。*) 由此产生的氢气-空气混合物的点燃归因于隔膜在球体下游启动压缩机时的运动引起的静电放电。不过,另一个可能的点火源是球体顶部的 ""防爆 ""风扇。

*隔膜上的氢泄漏可能是由于氯丁橡胶的氢渗透性造成的。氯丁橡胶和其他合成橡胶表皮的氢气和氧气扩散测量结果表明,这是德国一系列氢气填充气球爆炸的主要原因。","Electrostatic discharge caused by diaphragm motion

(Unused gas should also be returned, even if it has been less than two years since it was obtained.)	If the cylinder is less than two years old and there is a desire to keep it, then: Check the pressure of the cylinder. It must be within the maximum pressure stamped on the neck of the bottle. If the pressure is at or above the cylinder's maximum pressure, contact the vendor for pick up and disposal. Do not attempt to move the cylinder yourself.If below the cylinder's maximum pressure, vent excess pressure through an appropriate medium. Use a two-person team. Conduct venting in a fume hood. Control all ignition sources during venting, since most of the vent gas will be H2. At a minimum, wear chemical goggles, nitrile gloves, and a lab coat for protection against gaseous HF. Keep an HF exposure kit on hand. An eyewash and safety shower must be readily accessible (within a ten-second travel distance). Any skin, eye or respiratory irritation may be indicative of a possible exposure. Follow the first aid procedures listed on the exposure kit.
建议采取的行动：AHF 的建议安全储存时间为两年。如果气瓶使用时间超过两年,请联系供应商进行回收和处理（未使用的气体也应退还,即使从获得气瓶到现在还不到两年）。如果气瓶使用不到两年,并且希望继续使用,则应 检查气瓶的压力。压力必须在瓶颈上标注的最大压力范围内。如果压力达到或超过钢瓶的最大压力,请联系供应商进行回收和处理。不要试图自行移动钢瓶。如果低于钢瓶的最大压力,则通过适当的介质排出多余的压力。使用两人小组。在通风橱中进行排气。在排气过程中控制所有火源,因为大部分排出的气体都是 H2。至少要佩戴化学护目镜,丁腈橡胶手套和白大褂,以防止接触气态 HF。随身携带接触 HF 的工具包。必须可随时使用洗眼器和安全淋浴（在 10 秒的移动距离内）。任何皮肤,眼睛或呼吸道刺激都可能表明可能接触过 HF。按照接触急救包上列出的急救程序进行处理。","An anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (AHF) lecture bottle spontaneously exploded in a laboratory. No one was injured, but the lab was extensively damaged. The lecture bottle had split along its seam. Its cap and valve assembly were located to the immediate left.

Cause
	The explosion was caused by hydrogen gas pressure build up in the cylinder. AHF comes in carbon steel cylinders as a liquefied gas under a pressure of 0.9 psi at 70 oF (i.e., the vapor pressure of the liquid). Though cylinders should be passivated with fluorine, which forms a protective coating, over time AHF may slowly react with the iron in a cylinder to form iron fluoride and hydrogen gas. The generation of hydrogen gas may produce cylinder pressures as high as several hundred psi.
一个无水氟化氢（AHF）演讲瓶在实验室发生自燃爆炸。没有人受伤,但实验室遭到严重破坏。演讲瓶沿着接缝裂开。瓶盖和阀门组件位于左侧。

爆炸原因
爆炸是由于气瓶中的氢气压力升高引起的。碳钢钢瓶中的 AHF 是液化气体,在 70 oF 时压力为 0.9 psi（即液体的蒸汽压力）。虽然钢瓶应该用氟钝化,形成保护层,但随着时间的推移,AHF 可能会慢慢与钢瓶中的铁发生反应,形成氟化铁和氢气。氢气的产生可使气瓶压力高达几百 psi。","None

即使是新的安全系统组件,也要进行测试。不要靠听阀门的移动来确认阀门是否关闭；应测量下游压力来确定阀门是否真的密封良好。在气体歧管中工作时,应锁上阀门。在紧急情况下保持通往出口的畅通。","A person working in a hydrogen lab unknowingly closed the wrong hydrogen valve and proceeded to loosen a fitting in one of the hydrogen gas lines. The pressure in the 1/4""-diameter hydrogen line was approximately 110 psig. Hydrogen escaped from the loosened fitting and the pressure release resulted in the tubing completely detaching and falling to the floor. The person noted seeing a white stream around the hydrogen jet leak. The person noted a color change and noise change as the leak ignited (this happened in a matter seconds and he did not have a chance to react). The person left the lab and pushed the emergency stop button. Someone else pulled the fire alarm. Both of these actions were designed to close the main hydrogen solenoid (shutoff) valve. The local emergency response personnel realized that the hydrogen supply had not been turned off by the building safety systems and manually closed the main hydrogen valve next to the hydrogen tank farm.

The gas lab safety system has a main control panel. The hydrogen sensors, flame detectors, emergency push buttons, fire alarm and sprinkler system are all inputs into the control panel. In the event of an emergency, if any of these systems are engaged, the control panel should de-energize the main solenoid valve and stop the gas flow. However, this did not happen.

Onsite personnel were puzzled by the fact that apparently all of the safety systems had failed to close the main solenoid valve on that day. The onsite personnel questioned some key individuals on the testing of the emergency systems and found out that they confirmed solenoid valve closure, after activation of safety devices, by listening for evidence of valve movement (click).

The main solenoid valve was removed from the gas line manifold for inspection. It was evident just as it was taken out that the problem could have been due to an installation error. The valve was installed in a horizontal pipe run and 90° from upright. However, the solenoid valve had a marking on one side, which read: ""Mount vertical and upright (see instructions)"". This marking could not be seen when the valve was in the installed position. An arrow on the valve body showed what was considered to be the correct mounting position. The valve was tested in the upright position and it worked perfectly. However, when the valve was tested as installed (rotated 90° from upright), evidence of the valve stroking could be heard but it did not seal properly.

A new valve was ordered (identical to the old one), and it did not fully close when tested either (even when mounted as per the installation instructions). The new defective valve had to be returned to the manufacturer. To remedy the problem, the laboratory changed their piping configuration to have two valves in series in the system. They also changed their lab safety system testing procedures. Instead of listening for the valve movement to confirm valve closure, they measured the downstream pressure from the main valve as the safety devices were being activated.

Laboratory personnel could not determine with certainty the ignition source, but they suspect it could have been either static discharge or a power bar.

Corrective Steps:

	Place the hydrogen main shut off valve in the correct orientation.
	Change lab safety system testing procedures. Instead of using the valve noise to confirm valve closure, they measured the downstream pressure from the main valve as the safety devices were being activated.
	They also changed the lab working procedures and training to account for the human error.
一名在氢气实验室工作的人员在不知情的情况下关闭了错误的氢气阀门,进而松开了其中一个氢气管道的接头。1/4"" 直径氢气管道的压力约为 110 psig。氢气从松动的接头中逸出,压力释放导致管道完全脱落并掉到地上。该人员注意到在氢气喷射泄漏点周围看到一股白色气流。当泄漏点燃时,此人注意到了颜色的变化和噪音的变化（这发生在几秒钟内,他没有机会做出反应）。此人离开实验室并按下了紧急停止按钮。其他人拉响了火警警报。这两个动作的目的都是为了关闭氢气电磁（关闭）主阀。当地应急人员意识到大楼安全系统没有关闭氢气供应,于是手动关闭了氢气罐区旁边的氢气主阀。

气体实验室安全系统有一个主控制面板。氢气传感器,火焰探测器,紧急按钮,火灾报警器和自动喷水灭火系统均输入控制面板。在紧急情况下,如果这些系统中的任何一个启动,控制面板应切断主电磁阀的电源并停止气体流动。然而,这种情况并未发生。现场人员感到困惑的是,当天显然所有的安全系统都未能关闭主电磁阀。现场人员向一些关键人员询问了应急系统的测试情况,发现他们在启动安全装置后,通过倾听阀门移动（咔嗒声）的迹象来确认电磁阀是否关闭。

主电磁阀被从气管歧管上取下进行检查。从拆卸过程中可以明显看出,问题可能是由于安装错误造成的。阀门安装在水平管道上,与直立方向成 90°。然而,电磁阀的一侧有一个标记,上面写着：""垂直和直立安装（见说明）""： ""垂直直立安装（见说明书）""。当阀门处于安装位置时,无法看到该标记。阀体上的箭头显示了正确的安装位置。阀门在直立位置进行了测试,工作正常。但是,当按安装位置对阀门进行测试时（从直立位置旋转 90°）,可以听到阀门冲程的迹象,但密封不正常。

我们订购了一个新阀门（与旧阀门完全相同）,测试时也没有完全关闭（即使按照安装说明安装）。有缺陷的新阀门不得不退还给制造商。为了解决这个问题,实验室改变了管道配置,在系统中串联了两个阀门。他们还改变了实验室安全系统测试程序。他们不再通过聆听阀门的移动来确认阀门是否关闭,而是在安全装置启动时测量主阀的下游压力。

实验室人员无法确定点火源,但怀疑可能是静电放电或电源线。

纠正步骤：.

将氢气总截止阀置于正确的方向。
更改实验室安全系统测试程序。他们不再使用阀门噪音来确认阀门关闭,而是在安全装置启动时测量主阀的下游压力。
他们还更改了实验室工作程序和培训,以消除人为错误。","None

There have been 12 reportables in the last two years. As a result, a determination was made to issue a recurring occurrence report referencing management concern as its reporting criteria.

Engineering has recently made significant progress in further defining issues and potential corrective actions necessary to address the lower flammability limit (LFL) failures. The engineering path forward to resolution of this issue addresses potential failure contributors, among these are: Drift - This phenomenon is being closely assessed. Initial tests indicate the monitor power supply may be a significant contributor to instability resulting from the effects of temperature. Calibration Issues - Vendor-supplied parts and fabricated parts may be introducing small variations that, when eliminated, could improve reliability. Premature Sensor Degradation - Potential caused by increased surveillance frequency (i.e., normal performance of calibration surveillance).

The engineering path forward takes specific actions over the next several weeks that are aimed at better defining the contributors to monitor failure. Program improvements are underway to address these issues and provide resolution. The final product is targeting a more predictive approach to hydrogen monitor/analyzer performance.

The recurrent reportable events are dominated by a certain tank. This tank has operating characteristics that differ from most waste tanks because of its association with the in-tank precipitation process. The tank is subject of an engineering study. The performance of the actions specified in the path forward document will be able to provide a more in-depth look at the overall issues with hydrogen monitors than this analysis can. The path forward ultimately will address monitor dependability and use for all LWDP waste tanks.

Background:
	The hydrogen monitors in use in the LWDP tank farms have been the primary means of detecting the levels of hydrogen and benzene in the waste tanks since installation years ago. Over the lifetime of their service, failures of components within the monitor periodically occur. This continues even to this present time. As the tank farm facilities have operated over the years, various specifications and controls for operation have been placed into effect with regard to the hydrogen monitors. These specifications and controls were intended to ensure the natural generation of hydrogen gas within the waste tanks did not and does not reach explosive levels. Historically, the hydrogen monitors have been expected to operate with a very narrow range. The monitors were expected to maintain their calibration to within + - 2% LFL. This range was selected based on a general belief that it was conservative and appropriate for operation. There was no calculated technical basis for the + - 2% LFL assumption. An uncertainty calculation was approved to add expanded required accuracy limits to the LFL Monitor surveillances. The original + - 2% range was expanded to + - 6% LFL.

Corrective actions include evaluation of the current LFL monitor trending and analysis program to determine if the program needs to be improved. Include an evaluation and development of criteria that can be used to predict LFL monitor failures such as cal-to-cal changes and PI monitoring. Implement the improvements, as required.

Perform an LFL monitor procedure consistency review. Include procedures for FTF and HTF LFL monitors.

Evaluate the need for a replacement for the currently installed LFL monitors as compared to providing better temperature control in the existing LFL monitor enclosures, expanding the use of portable LFL instrumentation, or eliminating the sensor/transmitter 1.5 gain setting. Develop a temporary modification to test the replacement monitor, as necessary.

The currently installed LFL monitors utilize technology that is approximately 20 years old. A more modern technology should result in more stable operation of the LFL monitors. In addition, the current vendor no longer manufactures the currently installed LFL monitor controllers (that provide the %LFL display). The vendor now manufactures a new model. When the facility's existing spare parts are depleted, a replacement controller will have to be provided.

A potential replacement LFL monitor has been identified and is currently undergoing testing at the lab. For its operation, it relies upon a modern, electronic, solid-state sensor/transmitter system to provide a consistent display and signal output instead of the older technology currently used by the facility. Preliminary test results indicate that the replacement monitor is accurate, more stable, and easier to calibrate than the currently installed system. Both the potential replacement monitor and a monitor like the currently installed monitor were subjected to varying temperature and humidity conditions in an environmental chamber. During the tests, the replacement monitor was more stable and accurate than the currently used monitor.
液体废物处置项目（LWDP）在过去一年中经历了多次氢气监测仪/LFL 分析仪降解事件。在过去两年中,共发生了 12 起可报告事件。因此,决定发布一份以管理层关注为报告标准的重复事件报告。

最近,工程部门在进一步确定问题和解决易燃性下限 (LFL) 故障所需的潜在纠正措施方面取得了重大进展。解决这一问题的工程技术途径涉及潜在的故障促成因素,其中包括 漂移 - 正在对这一现象进行密切评估。初步测试表明,监测仪电源可能是温度影响导致不稳定的一个重要因素。校准问题 - 供应商提供的部件和制造的部件可能会产生微小的差异,如果消除这些差异,就能提高可靠性。传感器过早老化 - 监控频率增加（即校准监控的正常执行）可能导致传感器过早老化。

未来几周内,工程部门将采取具体行动,以更好地确定导致监测器故障的原因。目前正在进行计划改进,以解决这些问题并提供解决方案。最终产品的目标是为氢气监测仪/分析仪的性能提供更具预测性的方法。

反复出现的可报告事件主要发生在某个储罐中。由于与罐内沉淀过程有关,该储罐的运行特性与大多数废料储罐不同。对该储罐进行了工程研究。前瞻性文件中规定的行动的执行情况将能够比本分析报告更深入地了解氢气监测仪的整体问题。前进之路最终将解决所有 LWDP 废物罐的监测器可靠性和使用问题。

背景：
自多年前安装以来,LWDP 储罐区使用的氢气监测仪一直是检测废物罐中氢气和苯含量的主要手段。在其使用寿命期间,监测器内的部件不时发生故障。这种情况一直持续到现在。随着油库设施多年来的运行,氢气监测仪的各种操作规范和控制措施也已生效。这些规范和控制措施旨在确保废物罐内自然产生的氢气不会达到爆炸性水平。从历史上看,氢气监测仪的工作范围很窄。监测仪的校准应保持在 LFL + - 2% 的范围内。选择这一范围的依据是,人们普遍认为这一范围是保守的,适合操作。+ - 2% LFL 假设没有经过计算的技术依据。不确定性计算获得批准,为 LFL 监测器测量增加了更大的所需准确度限制。原来的 + - 2% 范围扩大到 + - 6% LFL。

纠正措施包括评估当前的 LFL 监测器趋势和分析程序,以确定是否需要改进该程序。包括评估和制定可用于预测 LFL 监测器故障的标准,如校准到校准的变化和 PI 监测。根据需要实施改进。

执行 LFL 监测器程序一致性审查。包括 FTF 和 HTF LFL 监测器的程序。

与在现有 LFL 监测器外壳中提供更好的温度控制,扩大便携式 LFL 仪器的使用范围或取消传感器/发射机 1. 5 增益设置。必要时,进行临时改装,以测试替换的监测仪。

目前安装的 LFL 监测器使用的是大约 20 年前的技术。更现代化的技术应使 LFL 监测器的运行更加稳定。此外,目前的供应商已不再生产目前安装的 LFL 监视器控制器（提供 %LFL 显示）。该供应商现在生产一种新的型号。当设施现有的备件耗尽时,将需要提供一个替代控制器。

已经确定了一个潜在的 LFL 监测器替代品,目前正在实验室进行测试。在运行过程中,它依靠现代化的电子固态传感器/传输系统来提供一致的显示和信号输出,而不是该设施目前使用的老式技术。初步测试结果表明,与目前安装的系统相比,更换后的监视器更准确,更稳定,更容易校准。潜在的替代监视器和与目前安装的监视器类似的监视器都在环境室中经受了不同温度和湿度条件的考验。在测试过程中,替代监视器比目前使用的监视器更稳定,更准确。","None

运行期间","The lessons learned in this situation center around basic conduct of operations principles. Policies and procedures related to operations performance, safety performance, and management oversight were in place. They were not employed appropriately.There were approved operations procedures in place to provide direction to personnel to ensure that the SHMS would be operated within its design basis. Those approved and available procedures provided the needed operational direction to accomplish safety, process quality, and control activities. Had the operator made use of the available procedures, the incident very likely would not have occurred.When operational direction is available (procedures, turnover logs, etc), compliance with that operational direction is required. Communications and shift turnover protocols in this situation were wholly inadequate. Accurate communication is essential for the safe and efficient operation of facilities, systems, and equipment; highly reliable communication provides accurate transmission of information within a facility. That transmission of communication did not occur in this situation. The facility operations personnel should have known the status of all equipment and systems, and should have been able to maintain control at all times. The saltwell pumping activities require interface and coordination between roving operators, specific evolution-related operators, and shift supervisors. That integrative communication did not take place. From the shift supervisor on down, shift personnel should have been aware of operations planned or in progress; status of facility systems and equipment; and any abnormal conditions which may have existed. That information was not effectively documented or transmitted. In addition, the authorization, communication, and documentation of status changes was not thoroughly executed.Startup and shutdown of systems and equipment require assessing status on a continuing basis. Notification of changes in system status by operators and shift supervisors must be comprehensive and complete to ensure an understanding of and adherence to precautions and prerequisites for safe shift evolutions.
在这种情况下汲取的经验教训主要围绕行动的基本原则。与运营绩效,安全绩效和管理监督有关的政策和程序已经到位。但这些政策和程序没有得到适当的运用。经批准的运营程序已经到位,可为工作人员提供指导,以确保 SHMS 在其设计基础上运行。这些经过批准的可用程序为完成安全,工艺质量和控制活动提供了所需的操作指导。如果操作员利用了现有的程序,事故很可能就不会发生。在有操作指导（程序,交接班记录等）的情况下,必须遵守操作指导。在这种情况下,沟通和交接班规程是完全不够的。准确的通信对于设施,系统和设备的安全高效运行至关重要；高度可靠的通信可在设施内提供准确的信息传输。在这种情况下,信息传递并不准确。设施操作人员本应了解所有设备和系统的状态,并应能够随时保持控制。盐井抽水活动需要巡回操作员,特定的进化相关操作员和轮班主管之间的相互配合和协调。这种综合沟通并没有进行。上至值班主管,下至值班人员,都应了解计划中或正在进行的操作,设施系统和设备的状态以及可能存在的任何异常情况。这些信息没有得到有效的记录或传递。此外,对状态变化的授权,沟通和记录也没有彻底执行。系统和设备的启动和关闭需要持续评估状态。操作员和轮班主管对系统状态变化的通知必须全面完整,以确保了解并遵守安全轮班的预防措施和先决条件。","One morning a saltwell pump was placed in operation. Operation of this equipment requires that the Standard Hydrogen Monitoring System (SHMS) cabinet be in operation. Later that morning, during the morning surveillance rounds, the Standard Hydrogen Monitoring System (SHMS) cabinet was found not to be in the operational mode.

On the previous day, the night shift saltwell operator assigned to run the saltwell pump had placed the SHMS monitor in operational mode; however, the saltwell system was not started at this time. Shift turnover was conducted and the condition of the SHMS was turned over to the appropriate saltwell operator and shift manager. During the day shift the day shift operator assigned to the complex received approval from the operations engineer to place the SHMS in ""dry out"" non-operational mode. Shift turnover was conducted and the saltwell operators did not know the condition of the SHMS had changed. The routine operators turned over the change in status among themselves. The shift managers, however, did not effectively communicate the status of the SHMS during their turnover activity.

The direct cause was attributed to the failure to use and follow available procedures. The night shift saltwell operator assigned to run the saltwell pump had placed the SHMS monitor in operational mode in accordance with appropriate procedure documentation. The next evening, the same night shift saltwell operator was again assigned to saltwell pumping activities. This operator ""listened to the unit"", concluded that the unit was running, and made the assumption that the SHMS was in operational mode. The operator did not use an available procedure which required him to confirm through physical verification the operational status of the SHMS. The pump was then started, without the SHMS monitor configured in the proper operational mode.
一天早上,盐井泵开始运行。该设备的运行要求标准氢监控系统 (SHMS) 柜处于运行状态。当天上午晚些时候,在晨间监视巡视时,发现标准氢气监控系统 (SHMS) 柜未处于运行模式。

The reactive metal treatment began with a review of the chemical inventory and setup of reaction vessels. The sodium metal was cut in shavings and added one at a time to the reaction vessel. After the second addition, an argon purge was added to disperse hydrogen gas faster. After approximately 10 pieces had been treated, the glass beaker shattered, releasing the contents of the reaction vessel (1 liter) inside the hood and causing the chemist's hand to receive superficial cuts. The process was being performed under a hood with all safety equipment in place. The employee was in personal protective equipment (PPE), but did receive two cuts on his hand through the glove. The treatment of reactive metals was being performed under an emergency treatment permit.

The direct/root cause of this occurrence has been determined to be human error in using a glass beaker to perform the treatment. The decision was made to use a glass beaker in order to viably watch the reactive material being treated. No one had any knowledge that the configuration of using stirrers and the use of a large glass beaker would restrict the release of hydrogen gas as quickly as possible.

The top flange was loosened using a copper/beryllium socket and a steel torque wrench. When questioned, the pipe-fitters correctly stated that this was allowable for initial loosening and tightening of these bolts. A copper/beryllium ratchet was used to accomplish the bolt removal. The bonded riser was shifted to allow access for the IH technician. The standard hydrogen monitoring system (SHMS) cabinet and local sample showed no hydrogen/flammable gas was present.

While the continuous vapor sample was being taken, the pipe-fitters proceeded to put together the copper/beryllium ratchet and socket with a 10"" steel socket extension to remove the bolts that were securing the spool piece at its base. These bolts were approximately 6"" to 8"" below grade and were only accessible through an 18"" access hole. The facility representative questioned this practice, as the steel extension could bump against the steel rim of the access hole and cause a spark near the open riser, and brought this issue to the attention of the person in charge (PIC). The PIC agreed that they could not use the steel extension.

Since the pipe-fitters did not have the copper/beryllium socket extension, one pipefitter proceeded to use a copper/beryllium crescent wrench in combination with a large copper/beryllium wrench to loosen the spool piece bolts. The other pipefitter proceeded to use a large copper/beryllium channel lock pliers to assist in removing the bolts. On approximately every fifth turn of the crescent wrench combination, the pipefitter lost his grip of the bolt he was turning and would swing his wrench out of control nearly hitting the unsecured, steel flange riser cover. He also nearly hit his fellow worker with the wrench on several occasions. The facility representative felt this operation was unsafe due to the pipefitter causing potential injury to his coworker and the potential for spark if the bonding and flange cover were knocked off the riser. He instructed the pipe-fitters to stop work and secure the flange cover/spool piece assembly. The pipe-fitters complied, using the copper/beryllium tools to secure the work site. The PIC, who had moved approximately 20' away to make phone calls requesting the copper/beryllium extension, returned to the containment tent and was immediately notified by the facility representative of the stop work instruction. The PIC had already determined the extension was not immediately available and was returning back to the work site to shut down the job. The work site was secured at approximately 1200 hours.

The direct cause of the event was management problem/work organization/planning deficiency. The proper tools were not staged at the work site, causing the craft to improvise. At the critique, the pipe-fitters indicated that they were given very little time after the pre-job brief to gather the tools needed for the job and had a combination of copper/beryllium and steel tools. After correctly loosening the flange, they assembled tools to loosen the spool piece. They did not have a Cu/Be extension and substituted a steel extension. This was stopped by the PIC when noted by the facility representative. While the PIC tried to locate the correct tool, the craft took it upon themselves to improvise, using tools of the proper material but of the improper type.
一名设施代表观察到管道安装工携带工具袋进入立管周围的隔离帐篷,工具袋中装有钢和铜/铍混合工具。使用铜/铍套筒和钢制扭矩扳手松开了顶部法兰。在接受询问时,管道安装工正确地指出,在最初松开和拧紧这些螺栓时可以这样做。拆卸螺栓时使用了铜/铍棘轮扳手。粘接的立管被移开,以便 IH 技术人员进入。标准氢气监测系统（SHMS）柜和局部取样显示没有氢气/可燃气体存在。

在连续采集水蒸气样本的同时,管道安装人员继续将铜/铍棘轮扳手和套筒与 10 英寸钢套筒加长杆组合在一起,以拆卸固定阀芯底部的螺栓。这些螺栓位于地面下约 6 英寸至 8 英寸处,只能通过一个 18 英寸的检修孔才能接触到。设备代表对这种做法提出质疑,因为钢制加长杆可能会碰到检修孔的钢边,并在打开的立管附近产生火花。负责人 (PIC) 同意他们不能使用钢制加长杆。由于管道安装工没有铜/铍套筒加长杆,一名管道安装工开始使用铜/铍月牙扳手和大号铜/铍扳手来松开线轴螺栓。另一名管道工则使用大型铜/铍槽形锁钳协助卸下螺栓。大约每转动五圈月牙扳手组合,该管道工就会失去对正在转动的螺栓的控制,从而使扳手失去控制,差点撞到未固定的钢制法兰立管盖。他还几次差点用扳手砸到他的同事。设备代表认为这种操作不安全,因为管道安装工可能会对他的同事造成伤害,而且如果粘合剂和法兰盖从立管上脱落,可能会产生火花。他指示管道安装工停止工作,并固定法兰盖/水槽组件。管道安装工遵照指示,使用铜/铍工具固定了施工现场。事先知情同意人已离开约 20 英尺远,打电话要求延长铜/铍的使用期限,他返回安全壳帐篷,并立即从设施代表处获悉了停止工作的指示。事先知情同意人已经确定无法立即获得延期,并返回工作现场关闭工作。大约 12 时,工作现场被封锁。

事件的直接原因是管理问题/工作组织/计划缺陷。没有在施工现场摆放适当的工具,导致施工人员临时起意。在批评会上,管道安装工表示,在工作前简报之后,他们只有很少的时间来收集工作所需的工具,并且只有铜/铍和钢工具。在正确松开法兰后,他们组装工具以松开线轴。他们没有铜/铍加长杆,用钢加长杆代替。当工厂代表注意到这一点时,事先知情同意人制止了他们的行为。当事先知情同意程序试图找到正确的工具时,这些工匠自作主张,使用了材料合适但类型不对的工具。","None

The laboratory will issue guidance regarding chemical storage hazards, identifying the hazard and requiring all chemicals to be stored according to compatibility, with secondary containment provided, in approved refrigerators.The main point to keep in mind is to minimize the quantities of reactive materials to be stored in refrigerators. Chemicals placed in refrigerators should be stored with regard to their chemical compatibility, and secondary containment should be provided to prevent contact with incompatible chemicals.Additional discussion about working with reactive metal-hydride materials in the laboratory can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website and in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
今后,实验室将就这一事件发布一份备忘录,以说明需要佩戴带侧护罩的安全 眼镜,以兼容方式储存化学品,在将化学品放入冰箱储存时要小心谨慎,并保持最 低数量。实验室将发布有关化学品储存危险的指南,确定危险性,并要求所有化学品必须根据兼容性储存在经批准的冰箱中,并提供二级密封。需要牢记的要点是尽量减少冰箱中储存的活性物质的数量。放置在冰箱中的化学品应根据其化学兼容性进行储存,并应提供二级防护,以防止与不兼容的化学品接触。有关在实验室中使用反应性金属氢化物材料的更多讨论,请参阅本网站的 ""经验总结 ""和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A 30-milliliter (mL) vacuum bulb, equipped with a glass stopcock, containing one gram of pentacarbonyl manganese hydride exploded in a refrigerator. This caused the breakage of three other containers, releasing some contents into the refrigerator. The chemicals did not react. The refrigerator contained numerous reactive and flammable chemicals, mostly in glass containers.

The damaged containers were removed and relocated under a hood. The refrigerator was then examined for other breakage and inventoried. All breakage was cleaned up. The safety coordinator was notified and began an investigation.

The direct cause of the occurrence was the failure of a glass vacuum bulb, which either fractured due to some unforeseen chemical reaction forming hydrogen gas, or was unable to resist some pressure buildup. The root cause is also attributable to the materials, either the chemical, or the vacuum bulb. The fact that refrigerators are commonly used throughout to store a variety of chemicals is not unique. However, this occurrence could have been much more severe if incompatible chemicals were involved.
一个装有 1 克五羰基氢化锰的 30 毫升（mL）真空球在冰箱中爆炸。这导致其他三个容器破裂,将一些内装物释放到冰箱中。这些化学品没有发生反应。冰箱中装有大量反应性和易燃化学品,大部分装在玻璃容器中。

已损坏的容器已被移走,并转移到罩子下面。然后检查了冰箱内的其他破损情况,并进行了清点。所有破损都已清理干净。安全协调员接到通知后开始进行调查。

发生事故的直接原因是一个玻璃真空灯泡发生故障,要么是由于某些不可预见的化学反应形成氢气而破裂,要么是无法抵抗某些压力的增加。根本原因还在于材料,要么是化学品,要么是真空灯泡。事实上,冰箱通常被用来储存各种化学品,这并不是唯一的原因。但是,如果涉及到不相容的化学品,这次事故可能会更加严重。","None

运行期间","Implementing and enforcing the laboratory's stop work and restart policy and procedures in conjunction with peer reviews for new processes and experiments should help prevent future accidents due to a lack of recognition of potential reactions and hazards. This abnormal event points out the need to call appropriate personnel when an abnormal event occurs. Safety personnel recommended all cleaning products be treated as potentially reactive mixtures.There is no such thing as an ""always safe"" cleaning solvent, including water. The reactivity and safety hazards of all materials must be considered, and only materials properly evaluated for the particular process involved must be selected.In the future, proposed processes and experiments need to be reviewed for potential hazards. Both a chemical engineer and chemist interviewed recognized the potential reactions and hazards when carbon and magnesium oxide or carbon and aluminum oxide are heated to above 1400° C. However, other staff members did not have the same degree of understanding of the potential reactions and hazards involved. The technician was instructed to clean the interior surface of the furnace top before the results of samples taken were analyzed because it was assumed that the support/spacer plate used during the process was an aluminum oxide plate. A peer review of proposed processes and experiments would have provided a needed potential reactions and hazards review.
在对新工艺和新实验进行同行评审的同时,实施和执行实验室的停工和重启政策和程 序,应有助于防止今后因缺乏对潜在反应和危害的认识而发生事故。这一异常事件表明,在发生异常事件时,需要呼叫相关人员。安全人员建议将所有清洁产品作为潜在反应混合物处理。不存在 ""永远安全 ""的清洁溶剂,包括水。必须考虑所有材料的反应性和安全隐患,并且只能选择经过适当评估,适用于特定工艺的材料。今后,需要对拟议的工艺和实验进行审查,以确定是否存在潜在危险。受访的一位化学工程师和化学家都认识到,当碳和氧化镁或碳和氧化铝加热到 1400 摄氏度以上时,可能会发生反应并造成危害。技术人员被指示在分析所采集样品的结果之前清洁炉顶的内表面,因为他们认为在此过程中使用的支撑/垫板是氧化铝板。对拟议的流程和实验进行同行评审本可以提供所需的潜在反应和危害评审。","The interior of a small high-temperature furnace, approximately 24 inches high by 18 inches wide, became contaminated with an unknown material later identified as magnesium. The furnace was disassembled to clean the unknown material from the interior surfaces, and while attempting to clean the bottom of the furnace, the technician tapped the upper lip of the furnace with a spatula and the magnesium flashed. The technician was stepping back from the furnace when the magnesium flashed. He received minor eye irritation and his eyebrows were singed.

Later that week the same technician was attempting to clean the interior surfaces of the top of the furnace and sprayed, as directed, the interior of the top with a water-based cleaning liquid which consisted of 91% water. He stepped around to the back of the unit to get a vacuum cleaner. While he was there, a small explosion occurred. No one was injured by the explosion. Although the furnace is located in a radiological control area, no radioactive contamination was involved.

The unknown material on the inside surfaces of the furnace top was found to be magnesium. A magnesium oxide support/spacer plate was inadvertently used during the process, and was subjected to a temperature of 1830 degrees centigrade in the presence of carbon. The magnesium oxide reacted with the carbon and generated magnesium metal. When the water-based cleaning liquid was sprayed on the magnesium, hydrogen gas was generated. The hydrogen gas subsequently was ignited by either a spark or by heat from the reaction. If the magnesium oxide support/spacer plate had not been used, then the generation of magnesium metal could not have occurred.

A sample taken the following morning was analyzed a couple of days later, and the analysis showed a definite presence of magnesium. Had this fact been determined immediately after the sample was taken, this occurrence could have been prevented. In the future, the lab is going to develop, implement, and enforce interim guidance covering ""Stop Work and Restart"" for work which has produced a hazardous condition. The procedure will specify when appropriate personnel should be called to respond. The guidance will also contain a requirement that the results of analytical samples be reviewed before work is allowed to restart.
一个高约 24 英寸,宽约 18 英寸的小型高温炉内部被一种后来被确认为镁的不明物质污染。技术人员在试图清理炉子底部时,用抹刀敲击了炉子的上唇,镁闪烁了一下。镁闪烁时,技术人员正从炉子旁后退。他的眼睛受到轻微刺激,眉毛被烧焦。

同一周晚些时候,该技术人员试图清洁炉顶的内表面,并按照指示向炉顶内部喷洒了含 91% 水的水基清洁液。他走到设备后面去拿吸尘器。当他走到那里时,发生了轻微的爆炸。没有人因爆炸受伤。虽然该熔炉位于放射性控制区,但没有涉及放射性污染。

炉顶内表面的不明物质被发现是镁。在加工过程中无意中使用了一块氧化镁支撑/垫板,在有碳存在的情况下温度达到 1830 摄氏度。氧化镁与碳发生反应,生成金属镁。当水基清洗液喷洒在镁上时,产生了氢气。氢气随后被火花或反应产生的热量点燃。如果没有使用氧化镁支撑/垫板,就不可能产生金属镁。

几天后,对第二天早上采集的样本进行了分析,分析结果显示确实存在镁。如果在取样后立即确定这一事实,就可以避免这种情况的发生。今后,实验室将制定,实施和执行有关 ""停止工作和重新开始 ""的临时指南,用于处理已产生危险状况的工作。该程序将明确规定何时应召集相关人员作出反应。该指南还将要求在允许重新开始工作之前对分析样本的结果进行审查。","None

Prior to re-entry, the hydrogen system was walked down to ensure that it was in a safe state and that the remote indicator showed no hydrogen present in the facility. Normal operations were suspended until the cause of the alarm could be determined.

The cause of the alarm was not escaping hydrogen gas, but drift in one of the eight monitoring system sensors.

检查期间","A flammable gas explosion is an analyzed hazard and gas detection/shut off is a safety significant control system that requires a limiting condition for operation (LCO). The rigor of the evaluation of flammable gas systems was inadequate. There was no independent calculation for the hydrogen cylinder and there was no report to document the findings of the evaluation. As a result, incorrect assumptions were made about the acceptability of the hydrogen cylinder. Calculations, independently verified by an engineer, must be included for processes involving a flammable gas and must accompany the hazard control plan for approval.
可燃气体爆炸是一种可分析的危险,而气体检测/关闭是一种需要限制运行条件（LCO）的重要安全控制系统。对可燃气体系统的评估不够严格。没有对氢气瓶进行独立计算,也没有报告记录评估结果。因此,对氢气瓶的可接受性做出了不正确的假设。涉及易燃气体的工艺必须包括由工程师独立验证的计算,并且必须随危险控制计划一起提交审批。","Facility management confirmed that a hydrogen gas cylinder did not comply with the limiting condition for operation (LCO) for flammable gas control systems in the lab's safety requirements. Earlier erroneous calculations had shown that a release of the entire contents of the cylinder into the hood could not reach the lower flammability limit (LFL).

The facility manager determined that the LCO was applicable and immediately entered the action statement in the safety system, which required immediate termination of normal operations in the affected wing of the building. Because normal operations had already been terminated in the wing for HVAC maintenance, further efforts to terminate normal operations were not necessary. The hydrogen cylinder was removed from the hood, thus removing the out-of-specification condition and rendering the LCO not applicable. Removal of out-of-specification conditions is a valid action, regardless of whether it is specifically stated in the LCO. Following removal of the hydrogen cylinder, the facility exited the LCO.

The hydrogen cylinder was only a hazard inside the limited volume of the hood. The cylinder was removed from the hood and secured in the laboratory. All laboratory spaces in the facility were walked down to verify that there were no other flammable gas cylinders that had been improperly excluded from the requirements for a flammable gas control system. No other problems were found.

In the future, a policy will require verification of calculations performed for the hazard control plans by an independent engineer and will be included with the hazard control plan when it is submitted for approval. In order to clear up interpretation issues surrounding the safety policies and the use of a gas detection/shut off control system, the LCO will be simplified to require that any flammable gas source that could exceed the LFL in its respective volume be removed or replaced within an hour of discovery.
设施管理部门确认,一个氢气钢瓶不符合实验室安全要求中关于可燃气体控制系统的操作限制条件（LCO）。先前错误的计算显示,将气瓶中的所有气体释放到通风橱中无法达到可燃性下限 (LFL)。

设备经理认定 LCO 适用,并立即在安全系统中输入了行动声明,要求立即终止受影响楼翼的正常操作。由于该侧翼的正常操作已经因暖通空调维护而终止,因此没有必要进一步终止正常操作。氢气瓶从气罩中取出,从而消除了超标情况,使 LCO 不适用。无论 LCO 中是否有明确规定,移除不符合标准的条件都是有效的行动。移除氢气瓶后,该设施退出了 LCO。

氢气瓶仅在气罩的有限空间内构成危险。氢气瓶已从通风橱中取出并固定在实验室内。对设施内的所有实验室空间进行了走访,以核实是否有其他可燃气体钢瓶被不当排除在可燃气体控制系统的要求之外。没有发现其他问题。

今后,一项政策将要求由一名独立工程师对危险控制计划的计算结果进行核实,并在危险控制计划提交审批时一并提交。为了澄清与安全政策和使用气体检测/关闭控制系统有关的解释问题,将简化《低浓 度气体控制条例》,要求在发现任何可能超过各自体积的低浓度气体源后一小时内将其移 除或更换。","None

This is accomplished through on-going training in emergency procedures, and in understanding the procedures and equipment.
尽管做了最充分的准备并认真遵守程序,实验室事故还是可能发生。不过,这里要吸取的教训是,员工必须始终确保自己了解活动的危险性,并知道如何应对紧急情况。要做到这一点,就必须不断接受应急程序培训,了解相关程序和设备。","A small hydrogen fire occurred in a chemical process hood. A chemist was performing an experiment reacting manganese dioxide with hydrogen to produce manganese oxide and water. The chemist had left the process, which would take approximately one hour to complete, and was working in a nearby lab. While the chemist was gone, a second worker heard a pop, saw the hydrogen fire in the hood, and requested the activation of a fire alarm. A third employee in the area activated a manual fire alarm. The chemist, upon hearing the fire alarm, returned to the room, shut off the hydrogen fuel supply, and evacuated the facility. The hydrogen fire lasted for approximately one minute. The remaining small fire was extinguished about 10 minutes later with a HALON portable fire extinguisher by a radiological control technician (RCT) assigned to the area when he entered to survey the room. The glass front on the hood was cracked, and except for the damage done to the glass column and equipment used in the process, there was no other damage.

The direct cause for this occurrence involved an equipment/material problem, defective or failed part. The glassware column used in the chemical reduction process failed. A hole developed in the side of the glassware column that allowed hydrogen to escape and be ignited by the heat tape wrapped around the glass tube. Due to the glass fire involvement, it could not be determined if the glassware column had failed or if the heat tape failed and created a hot spot which eventually caused a hole to develop in the glassware column. However, the glassware column that failed was used previously to perform this same process.
化学工艺罩内发生了小型氢气火灾。一名化学家正在进行二氧化锰与氢气反应生成氧化锰和水的实验。化学家离开了这个大约需要一小时才能完成的过程,正在附近的实验室工作。当化学家离开时,另一名工人听到 ""啪 ""的一声,看到罩内的氢气着火,并要求启动火灾报警器。该区域的第三名员工启动了手动火警警报器。化学家听到火警后返回房间,关闭了氢燃料供应,并撤离了设施。氢气起火持续了大约一分钟。大约 10 分钟后,分配到该区域的一名辐射控制技师 (RCT) 进入房间勘察,用哈龙（HALON）手提式灭火器扑灭了剩余的小火。机罩的玻璃前端破裂,除了玻璃柱和加工过程中使用的设备受损外,没有其他损坏。

这次事故的直接原因涉及设备/材料问题,缺陷或故障部件。化学还原过程中使用的玻璃器皿柱发生故障。玻璃器皿柱的侧面出现了一个洞,导致氢气泄漏,并被包裹在玻璃管上的热胶带点燃。由于玻璃着火,无法确定是玻璃器皿柱失效,还是热胶带失效并产生了一个热点,最终导致玻璃器皿柱上出现了一个洞。不过,发生故障的玻璃器皿柱以前曾用于执行相同的工艺。","None

To guard against complacency, it is necessary to emphasize adherence to established procedures, including appropriate reviews of preventive maintenance instructions (PMI) and related on-the-job training (OJT). Another lesson learned was that the craftsmen need to be familiar with the total system safety controls. They did not realize, for example, that the furnaces would automatically purge hydrogen with an inert gas for safety reasons in the event of a flow interruption. Had they known this, they would not have been in a hurry to correct the error and turn the hydrogen back on. The hurried action caused an immediate surge in the flow, and in turn caused the excess flow valve to shut. This compounded one error into two errors. They should have stopped when they initially made the error, and notified the hydrogen system engineer.
在执行分配的工作任务时,必须恪尽职守。为防止骄傲自满,有必要强调遵守既定程序,包括适当审查预防性维护说明 (PMI)和相关在职培训 (OJT)。另一个教训是,技工需要熟悉整个系统的安全控制。例如,他们没有意识到,为了安全起见,在流量中断的情况下,熔炉会自动用惰性气体吹扫氢气。如果他们知道这一点,就不会急于纠正错误并重新开启氢气。匆忙的动作导致流量立即激增,进而导致过量流量阀门关闭。这就把一个错误变成了两个错误。他们应该在最初出错时就停止,并通知氢气系统工程师。","An unplanned shutdown of the hydrogen supply system occurred, affecting the hydrogen furnaces in the plant. The apparent cause was an inadvertent valve closing, which was contrary to the written procedure.

A preventative maintenance activity was being conducted on the hydrogen gas system. Shortly after starting that work, various hydrogen gas users notified the emergency response personnel that the hydrogen supply safety alarms sounded, indicating an interruption of the hydrogen gas supply. As a result, the hydrogen furnaces shut down. This shut down is an automated process which injects an inert gas (nitrogen or argon) to prevent the introduction of oxygen and its mixing with any hydrogen gas. All shut downs functioned as designed. As a precautionary measure, fire protection personnel manually checked the furnaces for the presence of oxygen. Only residual oxygen was found.

Simultaneously, while the hydrogen furnace users were reporting the supply interruption, the on-shift utility operator notified the facility’s hydrogen systems engineer of a flow valve alarm condition. The maintenance craftsmen immediately realized that valves were operated out of sequence while the above referenced maintenance activity was being conducted.

The direct cause was a deficiency in procedures that did not include consequences of failing to follow the procedure and the immediate actions to be taken in the event of error. The contributing cause was determined to be a training deficiency, since no formal records indicated who had received the necessary maintenance training. Additionally, the training was insufficient in that it did not cover system safety controls. The root cause was determined to be personnel error in that the craftsmen performing the preventive maintenance task did not follow the established written procedures.
氢气供应系统发生意外停机,影响了工厂的氢气炉。明显的原因是阀门关闭不慎,违反了书面程序。

当时正在对氢气系统进行预防性维护。工作开始后不久,各氢气用户通知应急人员,氢气供应安全警报响起,表明氢气供应中断。因此,氢气炉关闭。这种关闭是一个自动过程,注入一种惰性气体（氮气或氩气）,以防止氧气进入并与任何氢气混合。所有的关闭都按设计进行。作为预防措施,消防人员手动检查了熔炉中是否存在氧气。结果只发现了残留的氧气。

与此同时,在氢气炉用户报告供应中断的同时,当班的公用设施操作员通知了该设施的氢气系统工程师流量阀出现了报警情况。维修技工立即意识到,在进行上述维修活动时,阀门的操作顺序被打乱了。直接原因是程序存在缺陷,没有包括不遵守程序的后果和出错时应立 即采取的行动。促成原因是培训不足,因为没有正式记录显示谁接受了必要的维护培训。此外,培训内容也不够充分,没有涉及系统安全控制。根本原因被确定为人员失误,因为执行预防性维护任务的技工没有遵守既定的书面程序。","None

工作人员应注意,需要特殊收货检查的物品在使用前仍应由最终用户核实/检查。鉴于厌氧室和附近的相关电气设备在设计时并未考虑或预计会处理潜在的爆炸性环境,如果没有发现问题,也没有成功地清除氢气混合物,那么几乎所有发生更严重事件的必要条件都已具备。本网站的 ""经验教训 ""栏目讨论了在厌氧室中使用氢气的问题。","A laboratory research technician entered a lab to begin preparing samples that were to ultimately be purged in an anaerobic chamber (glove box) located in that room. As the technician walked into the lab, she looked at the chamber to see if it was adequately inflated. This chamber is equipped with a gas concentration meter, capable of simultaneously displaying the oxygen and hydrogen concentrations of the chamber atmosphere. Under normal operating conditions, the atmosphere inside the chamber is comprised of 0% oxygen (as intended/desired for an anaerobic atmosphere), approximately 2-3% hydrogen, and with the remaining balance being nitrogen (approximately 98-97%). Under such normal operating conditions, the hydrogen concentration inside the chamber is less than the lower explosive limit (LEL) of hydrogen to prevent an explosion in case air or oxygen were ever inadvertently introduced into the chamber. When the technician observed the meter's digital readouts, the oxygen concentration in the chamber was still 0% but the hydrogen concentration was at 43%. (The explosive range of hydrogen in air is 4% to 75%) An alarm light was also flashing on the meter, but an audible alarm was not heard. (At first, the technician turned the meter off and back on again believing something was wrong with the meter. She then checked the placarding of the compressed gas cylinders that were hooked up to the chamber manifold system and discovered that one of the cylinders was a mixture of 95% hydrogen and 5% nitrogen, instead of the 5% hydrogen and 95% nitrogen cylinder that was supposed to be there and immediately summoned assistance. The face of the manifold onto which the erroneous cylinder was connected is labeled as ""5% H2/95% N2"". The cylinder was last changed out 30 days prior to the incident, by the facility's maintenance personnel. And equipment user log indicates that the chamber had been used a couple of times since the cylinder change-out. In addition to the manifold labeling, there are also job aid instructions posted in the work area pertaining to the operation of the chamber by the laboratory researchers.

Evidence is present to show that the research staff actually requested a mixture 5% H2 and 95% N2 through the onsite acquisition system, but the vendor failed to supply the customer with the requested mixture; instead, a mixture of 95% H2 and 5% N2 was supplied. The investigation team determined that a mixture of 95% H2 and 5% N2 would have never been in the facility (for maintenance staff and end users to select from) had the vendor error not occurred.
一名实验室研究技术人员进入实验室开始准备样品,这些样品最终将被净化到实验室内的厌氧室（手套箱）中。当技术员走进实验室时,她看了看厌氧室是否充气充分。厌氧室配有一个气体浓度计,能够同时显示厌氧室内的氧气和氢气浓度。在正常工作条件下,试验舱内的气氛由 0% 的氧气（厌氧气氛的预期/期望值）,约 2-3% 的氢气和剩余的氮气（约 98-97%）组成。在这种正常工作条件下,试验舱内的氢气浓度低于氢气的爆炸下限 (LEL),以防止在空气或氧气意外进入试验舱时发生爆炸。当技术人员观察流量计的数字读数时,舱内的氧气浓度仍为 0%,但氢气浓度已达 43%。(氢气在空气中的爆炸范围是 4% 至 75%）测量仪上的报警灯也在闪烁,但没有听到声音报警。(起初,技术人员认为测量仪出了问题,将测量仪关闭后又重新打开）。随后,她检查了连接到舱室歧管系统的压缩气瓶的标牌,发现其中一个气瓶是 95% 氢气和 5% 氮气的混合物,而不是应该有的 5% 氢气和 95% 氮气气瓶,于是立即请求援助。连接错误气瓶的歧管面上标有 ""5% H2/95% N2""。气瓶最后一次更换是在事件发生前 30 天,由设备维护人员进行的。设备用户日志显示,在更换气瓶后,舱室被使用过几次。除了歧管标签外,工作区还张贴了有关实验室研究人员操作试验室的工作辅助说明。

有证据显示,研究人员实际上通过现场采集系统要求提供 5% H2 和 95% N2 的混合物,但供应商未能向客户提供所要求的混合物,而是提供了 95% H2 和 5% N2 的混合物。调查小组认定,如果供应商没有出错,设施中就不会有 95% H2 和 5% N2 的混合物（供维护人员和最终用户选择）。","None

The HPT went to the building where auxiliary gas cylinders are stored. He located a P-10 gas cylinder and turned to search for a hand-cart. There were no hand-carts present, and the technician had to get one from another room. When he returned to the cylinder storage area, he loaded the wrong cylinder. It contained hydrogen gas instead, however, the two cylinders were next to each other and they were basically identical. The empty cylinder was then replaced by the full one and the scaler was purged for several minutes before it was used. The alpha channel worked well, however, the beta channel did not respond. An instrument technician was contacted to identify any possible electronic failures in the instrument and he discovered that the gas was hydrogen rather than the P-10 gas. The hydrogen cylinder was shut off, disconnected and removed. The correct P-10 cylinder was located and connected to the scaler.
一名健康物理技师（HPT）发现,分析实验室的一台除垢器没有 P-10 气体（90%Ar 和 10% CH4）。HPT 来到存放辅助气瓶的大楼。他找到了一个 P-10 气瓶,然后转身去找手推车。但当时没有手推车,技术员只好从另一个房间找来一辆。当他返回气瓶存放区时,却装错了气瓶。不过,这两个钢瓶是挨在一起的,它们基本上是一样的。随后,他将空钢瓶换成了满钢瓶,并在使用前对除垢器进行了几分钟的吹扫。阿尔法通道工作正常,但贝塔通道没有反应。他发现气体是氢气而不是 P-10 气体。氢气瓶被关闭,断开并移走。找到了正确的 P-10 气瓶,并将其连接到除垢仪上。","None

The moderator assembly consists of an exterior metal vacuum jacket with an interior metal transfer line and canister that contain liquid hydrogen. The moderator canister is constructed of aluminum and is approximately five inches wide, five inches high, and two inches deep. The liquid hydrogen supply lines to the moderator canister are constructed of stainless steel. The operating temperature of the moderator varies from -420 degrees Fahrenheit to a possible 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Mechanical operators discovered a leak following a cleaning operation on the moderator. The cleaning operation was performed to remove impurities that could freeze and reduce flow in the transfer line. Since the moderator is constrained and not readily accessible by personnel, inspections could not be performed to determine the exact location or cause of the leak.

Possible causes for the leak were:

	Material failure from the cycling of the unit between the working temperature of -420 degrees Fahrenheit to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
	Changes in material caused by possible overheating of the unit. The existing moderator did not have a thermocouple so that temperatures could be monitored and operations modified, if necessary.
	Over-pressurization of the unit from possible overheating.

造成泄漏的可能原因有

装置在工作温度-420 华氏度至 300 华氏度之间循环运行导致材料失效。
装置可能过热导致材料发生变化。现有的慢化剂没有热电偶,因此无法监测温度并在必要时修改操作。设备可能因过热而过压。","None

This system is used to detect and warn facility employees of an explosive or flammable environment. An explosive or flammable environment can only occur if there is a leak in the system, which would not be expected to occur during normal operations. When the system was reactivated, no leaks were indicated.

The incident had the following three causes:

	A procedure describing administrative controls necessary to ensure safe operations in the area should have been developed and implemented prior to disabling the hydrogen monitoring system.
	The hydrogen monitor was not hard-wired, which allowed it to be unplugged and rendered inoperable.
	The hydrogen monitors were disabled and the status of the monitors was not communicated to personnel that work in the area.

The HMLD heater circuit and the ion pump and its associated controller were de-energized and red-tagged to ensure the system remained shut down. The ion pump and controller were later found energized. The ion pump circuit is a low-power (120-V, 1 amp) circuit and the pump operates in the micro-amp range. There was no damage to equipment from this inadvertent energization. There was also no personnel safety hazard since the tag out was not for maintenance purposes and since the system was in its normal operating configuration.

The direct cause is listed as personnel error, inattention to detail. This category most closely describes the inadvertent actuation of the controller toggle switch. This incident reinforced the need for refresher training to remind personnel to pay attention to details while performing maintenance and when hanging red tags.

Operations personnel received refresher training on the installation of red tags. Emphasis was placed on not using toggle switches as the isolation device when red-tagging equipment. The objective is to prevent inadvertent actuation/operation of red-tagged equipment. Critical Systems Maintenance (CSM) will discuss this occurrence at a scheduled safety meeting. The importance of maintaining equipment status as required by installed red tags will be emphasized.

The battery charging facility is used for charging the various forklift batteries for the shipping and receiving operation. The building is approximately 450 sq. ft. and has four charging stations. Emergency response was initiated and the incident commander responded to the scene. Initial air monitoring indicated readings above the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) for hydrogen gas. The local fire department responded and setup for the situation. Facilities personnel responded and turned power off to the building. The building was ventilated and verified to be safe by the fire department. There were no injuries or damage.

The exhaust fan for the building failed, allowing hydrogen gas to build up. A mechanical failure in the fan caused the automatic on/off sensor to overheat and shut the fan off.

The Preliminary Hazard Assessment (PHA) did not include the hazard of hydrogen buildup in the building from an exhaust fan failure. Because of this, there was no back-up exhaust system in place to keep this from becoming a problem.

The original PHA for the battery charging facility did not address the hazard of hydrogen buildup from an exhaust fan failure. The PHA will be revised to include this new information. Some additional concerns that were addressed were the addition of a vent and cooling system, a hard-wired breaker box switch, and the posting of the forklift battery charging procedures in the building. These additional concerns did not contribute to the occurrence, but were identified as improvements.

大楼的排气扇发生故障,导致氢气积聚。风扇的机械故障导致自动开关传感器过热并关闭了风扇。

电池充电设施最初的《安全和健康防护措施》没有涉及排风扇故障导致氢气积聚的危险。将对 PHA 进行修订,以纳入这一新信息。已解决的其他一些问题包括增加通风和冷却系统,断路器开关的硬接线以及在大楼内张贴叉车电池充电程序。这些额外的问题并没有导致事故的发生,但被确定为改进措施。","None

在系统改造的设计,制造和安装过程中,危险评估至关重要,以确保在系统启动和运行前解决危险和潜在危险。","A process area alarm activated. The alarm was caused by an instrument channel located above a reaction vessel off-gas system final HEPA filter canister, which indicated 25% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) for hydrogen. Since the only source of hydrogen is from the reaction vessel during the reaction of sodium with concentrated sodium hydroxide, the immediate actions were to shutdown the reaction process and place the facility in a safe condition.

The root cause was inadequate or defective design. Had the pre-filter drains been vented to outside the building, no hydrogen could accumulate in the process area. The corrective action for this is to complete an Engineering Task Authorization (ETA) to install a sample/drain collection system with loop seals to prevent any release of hydrogen to the process area. The direct cause was the pre-filter canister drain valve being left open after the fluid stopped draining, which allowed hydrogen from the reaction vessel off-gas system to accumulate, causing the alarm at 1% hydrogen in air. A contributing cause may have been that the operator was not properly instructed to shut the valve immediately when the fluid stopped draining. Corrective action for this is to issue improved instructions for sampling/draining the off gas system and training the operators on these improved procedures. An ETA was also initiated to provide interlocks and administrative controls to ensure the process area roof exhaust fans are running prior to beginning reaction vessel sodium injection and stop sodium injection should either fan stop running.

The source of the hydrogen released to the process area was traced to the routine operation of draining accumulated fluid from the one of two off-gas system pre- filter canisters. This is done to the off line filter canister every six hours when the filters are shifted. This has been done routinely since the filter drains were installed. Approximately 188 hours of sodium reaction at .75 gpm sodium flow has been completed with no other hydrogen alarms being received. The sodium reaction process was restarted a few hours later with concurrence of facility management. Hydrogen leak checks were completed on the off-gas system with none found.
工艺区警报启动。警报是由位于反应容器废气系统最终 HEPA 过滤器罐上方的仪器通道引起的,该通道显示氢气含量为爆炸下限 (LEL) 的 25%。由于氢气的唯一来源是钠与浓氢氧化钠反应过程中反应容器中产生的氢气,因此立即采取的行动是关闭反应过程并将设施置于安全状态。

根本原因是设计不足或存在缺陷。如果预过滤器的排水口排到建筑物外,工艺区就不会积聚氢气。为此采取的纠正措施是完成工程任务授权 (ETA),安装带回路密封的样本/排水收集系统,以防止氢气泄漏到加工区。直接原因是预滤器滤罐排水阀在液体停止排水后一直处于打开状态,使得反应容器废气系统中的氢气积聚,导致空气中氢含量达到 1%时发出警报。其中一个原因可能是操作员没有得到正确的指示,在液体停止排出时没有立即关闭阀门。为此采取的纠正措施是发布改进后的废气系统取样/排水说明,并对操作员进行有关这些改进程序的培训。此外,还启动了一项紧急措施,以提供联锁和管理控制,确保在开始反应容器钠注入之前,工艺区屋顶排气扇运转,并在任何一个排气扇停止运转时停止钠注入。

氢气释放到工艺区的源头可追溯到从两个废气系统预滤器中的一个滤器中排出积液的常规操作。每隔六小时更换过滤器时,都要将积液排到离线过滤器罐中。自安装过滤器排水器以来,这项工作一直是例行的。钠反应时间约为 188 小时,钠流量为 75 加仑/分。75 加仑/分钟的钠反应时间,没有收到其他氢气警报。几小时后,经设备管理部门同意,重新启动了钠反应过程。对废气系统进行了氢气泄漏检查,未发现任何泄漏。","None

An elevated temperature in the chamber resulted in a small fire that was confined to the environmental chamber. Visual observation indicated no damage to nearby equipment, including nearby computer cables.

A committee was assembled with the task of identifying the cause of the incident. The committee concluded that the fire was caused by failure of the heater control system for the environmental chamber. The failure of the heater control system caused the chamber temperature to eventually exceed 200°C. As the chamber temperature increased, plastic materials and electrical insulation present in the chamber started to decompose. A battery scheduled for testing was also located in the chamber. As the temperature of the chamber rose, it is likely that water and possibly potassium hydroxide present in the individual cells of the battery components decomposed to yield hydrogen. At some point, these decomposition products ignited, caused either by the chamber temperature exceeding the ignition temperature or by sparks due to shorting of the electrical leads.

A subcommittee reviewed the electrical schematic and instruction manual for the environmental chamber. This group then energized the chamber to observe and troubleshoot the components crucial to temperature control and over-temperature protection. This was done by trained personnel using safe electrical ""hot"" work practices and appropriate lockout/tag-out procedures. Testing with the main power on, a simulated temperature was generated to exceed the set point for shut down of the heaters to the chamber. During this testing, it was observed that the over-temperature pilot light illuminated at the set point; however, the trip coil on the circuit breaker did not energize and, thus, did not shut down the chamber. It was clear at this point that there were two failures in the control circuitry; prior to the failure of the circuit breaker, there should have been a shutdown of the temperature control system. Further investigation identified a failure in the temperature controller card, allowing the chamber heaters to come on and stay on. Testing indicates that the chamber does operate, and with replacement of these failed parts, would operate properly.
在 0°C 环境温度测试期间,密封环境舱内出现温度偏移。舱内温度升高导致环境舱内起火。肉眼观察显示,附近的设备（包括附近的计算机电缆）没有损坏。

成立了一个委员会,任务是查明事故原因。委员会得出结论,火灾是由环境舱加热器控制系统故障引起的。加热器控制系统故障导致环境室温度最终超过 200°C。随着环境舱温度的升高,舱内的塑料材料和电气绝缘材料开始分解。环境舱内还有一块计划进行测试的电池。随着试验室温度的升高,电池组件单个电池中的水和氢氧化钾可能会分解产生氢气。在某一时刻,这些分解产物被点燃,原因可能是试验室温度超过了点火温度,也可能是电线短路产生了火花。

一个小组委员会审查了环境室的电路图和说明手册。随后,该小组为试验室通电,观察温度控制和过温保护的关键部件并排除故障。这项工作由经过培训的人员完成,他们采用了安全的电气 ""高温 ""工作方法和适当的锁定/挂牌程序。在主电源接通的情况下进行测试,模拟温度超过了关闭加热室加热器的设定点。在测试过程中,观察到超温指示灯在设定点亮起；但是,断路器上的跳闸线圈没有通电,因此没有关闭加热室。此时很明显,控制电路出现了两个故障；在断路器出现故障之前,温度控制系统应该已经关闭。进一步的调查发现,温度控制器卡出现故障,导致腔室加热器开启并保持开启状态。测试表明,反应室确实在运行,只要更换这些故障部件,反应室就能正常运行。","None

The control room operator initiated the appropriate alarm response procedure and the facility entered limiting conditions of operation. At the time of the alarm, the facility was experiencing severe weather and the field operator was unable to investigate the alarm in the field. After the severe weather cleared, the field operator investigated the alarm and found the sample flow to be low and out-of-limits.

At the given facility, composite lower flammability limit (CLFL) monitors are used to detect the presence of hydrogen and other flammable gases in waste tank vapor spaces. Maintaining the concentration of flammable vapors in tank vapor spaces below CLFL levels maintains tank integrity by preventing the possibility of fires, deflagrations and explosions. The CLFL point of a combustible gas is defined as the minimum concentration of that particular vapor that is combustible in a dry air atmosphere. In gas detection systems, the amount of gas present is specified in units of % CLFL and is usually displayed on a meter in these units. The flammable gas of primary concern for the tank is hydrogen.

The flammable range of hydrogen is from 4.0% to 74.2% by volume in air. A hydrogen concentration of 4.0% in air is equal to 100% LFL. Hydrogen concentrations less than 4.0% will not burn, assuming it is the only source of fuel. To alert personnel to the buildup of potentially dangerous levels of explosive gases in the tank, a Combustible Gas Detection System is used to monitor and analyze sample gas drawn from the tank vapor space. The indicating range of this unit is 0-100% LFL indication which corresponds to 0-100% of span and 4-20 mADC transmitter output.

The rotameter is a variable output device for measuring and controlling flow consisting of an orifice type valve seat and needle valve assembly. The valve seat is made of a resilient material and is machined to match the surface of the needle valve. Flow is controlled by moving the needle valve in and out of the valve seat. After flow moves through the valve seat, it enters a cone shaped chamber that is wider at the top. Graduations on the side of the chamber indicate flow (typically in scfm, standard cubic feet per minute, or cfh, cubic feet per hour). A weighted float rides on the cushion of gas or fluid flowing through the chamber. During this event, it was determined that the valve seat had worn down so that the shape of the orifice did not match the shape of the needle valve which caused irregular and uncontrolled flow.
控制室收到储罐可燃性下限 (LFL) 分析仪低样品流量警报。控制室操作员启动了相应的警报响应程序,设施进入极限运行状态。警报发出时,工厂正遭遇恶劣天气,现场操作员无法在现场调查警报。恶劣天气过去后,现场操作员对警报进行了调查,发现样本流量较低且超出了限制条件。

在该设施中,复合可燃性下限 (CLFL) 监测器用于检测废物罐蒸气空间中是否存在氢气和其他可燃气体。将储罐蒸汽空间中的易燃蒸汽浓度保持在复合可燃性下限水平以下,可以防止发生火灾,爆燃和爆炸,从而保持储罐的完整性。可燃气体的 CLFL 点被定义为在干燥空气环境中可燃的特定蒸汽的最低浓度。在气体检测系统中,存在的气体量以 CLFL% 为单位,通常以这些单位显示在仪表上。储罐主要关注的可燃气体是氢气。

氢气在空气中的可燃范围为 4.0% 至 74.2%（按体积计算）。空气中 4. 0% 的氢气浓度等于 100% LFL。氢气浓度低于 4. 0% 不会燃烧,假设它是唯一的燃料来源。为了提醒工作人员注意油箱中潜在的危险爆炸性气体浓度,可燃气体检测系统用于监测和分析从油箱蒸汽空间抽取的气体样本。该装置的指示范围为 0-100% LFL 指示,相当于量程的 0-100% 和 4-20 mADC 变送器输出。

转子流量计是一种用于测量和控制流量的可变输出装置,由孔型阀座和针阀组件组成。阀座由弹性材料制成,经加工与针阀表面相匹配。通过针阀进出阀座来控制流量。流量通过阀座后,会进入一个顶部较宽的锥形腔。腔体侧面的刻度表示流量（通常以 scfm（标准立方英尺/分钟）或 cfh（立方英尺/小时）为单位）。配重浮子漂浮在流经腔室的气体或流体的缓冲垫上。在这次事件中,确定阀座已经磨损,因此阀孔的形状不符合要求。","None

Upon opening the valve, the hydrogen gas line failed at a fitting on the switching manifold, releasing a small amount of hydrogen gas. The staff member closed the valve immediately, then inspected the gas line and found the front ferrule (of the compression-style fitting) to be missing. There were no injuries or damage to equipment.

In the follow-on discussion with research staff, it was learned that approximately one month earlier, a similar condition (front ferrule missing from a fitting) was found while performing a modification to a similar manifold. Following a critique, management expressed concerns relative to the installation and commissioning of compressed gas systems, specifically in regard to proper system installation and responsibility for required leak testing. Elevating this issue to a management concern will ensure that procedures and processes are reviewed and revised as necessary to clarify roles and responsibilities for compressed gas systems, further assuring users of new or modified systems that they have received proper reviews and testing.

Start-up testing was considered less than adequate because the appropriate level of testing did not occur for the type of system being installed or its intended use. The person installing the compressed gas line into a compression style fitting tee failed to include the front ferrule. Later, when the line was pressurized at 1500 psi, the fitting and line separated.
当研究人员在实验室工作时,一名工作人员打开了连接到实验室仪器供应歧管的 0. 2 英寸（1500 psi）氢气管道的主阀门。打开阀门后,氢气管道在切换歧管上的一个接头处发生故障,释放出少量氢气。工作人员立即关闭了阀门,然后检查了气管,发现（压缩式接头的）前端卡套不见了。没有人员伤亡或设备损坏。

在与研究人员的后续讨论中得知,大约一个月前,在对类似的歧管进行改装时也发现了类似的情况（接头的前卡套丢失）。在批评之后,管理层对压缩气体系统的安装和试运行表示关切,特别是正确的系统安 装和所需的泄漏测试责任。将这一问题提升为管理层关注的问题,将确保对程序和流程进行必要的审查和修订,以明确压缩气体系统的作用和责任,进一步确保新系统或改装系统的用户得到适当的审查和测试。启动测试被认为不够充分,因为没有针对所安装的系统类型或其预期用途进行适当级别的测试。将压缩气体管线安装到压缩式接头三通的人员没有安装前卡套。后来,当管道加压到 1500 psi 时,接头和管道分离了。","None

The sensor is installed in the flow stream of the exhauster designed to be used with a RMCS truck for core sampling of watch list tanks, and is part of the flammable gas detector system. During the previous week, a quarterly calibration of the sensor, per maintenance procedure, was attempted by Characterization Project Operations (CPO) technicians. Ambient temperatures during the sensor calibration were approximately 20 to 30 degrees F. Inconsistencies in calibration results and the failure of the sensor to meet the response-time calibration requirement lead to the conclusion that the unit could not reliably perform its safety function at low ambient temperatures. The hydrogen sensor is an electrochemical cell used to initiate alarms and shut down the RMCS system in the case of a hydrogen release in the tank being sampled. The sensor is from the same vendor and category of sensor used in the tank farm Standard Hydrogen Monitoring System (SHMS) cabinets. However, the SHMS cabinets are climate-controlled, whereas the RMCS application does not provide a climate-controlled enclosure for the sensor. The RMCS exhauster flammable gas detector is required to operate in outdoor temperatures down to -20 degrees F.

The hydrogen sensor is one of two independent sensors in the exhauster flammable gas detector. The other sensor has not experienced these calibration problems. The flammable gas detector is not required for push-mode core sampling. During further investigation of the RMCS exhauster hydrogen detector system, a deficiency was discovered in the application of low-pressure differential transmitters. The low-pressure differential transmitters are qualified for use in a Class 1, Division 1, Group B environment. The transmitters are rated for input voltages of 12 to 36 volts per the vendor's catalog. However, during the process of reviewing the test reports, it was discovered that to be qualified for use in a Class 1, Division 1, Group B environment, the transducer must be configured in a specific fashion. This configuration is defined in the control drawing, which requires that the ""associated apparatus"" must provide no more than 20 volts. However, the intrinsic safety transmitter supply unit used in the exhauster hydrogen detector system could allow a maximum amount of 28 volts open circuit. Characterization Equipment Engineering concluded that this condition could result in a non-compliance with the intrinsic safety requirements of the National Electrical Code, Article 504, and ANSI/ISA-RP12.6 ""Installation of Intrinsically Safe Systems for Hazardous (Classified) Locations.""

The direct cause of the deficiencies is an inadequate design. The functional design criteria require that the system operate in a -20° F to 115° F environment. Although the vendor specifications for the cell require operating temperatures of 70° F to 120° F, the system design did not provide thermal protection for the cell.
在旋转模式岩心取样（RMCS）便携式排气装置中应用氢传感器时发现了一个缺陷。该传感器安装在排气装置的气流中,旨在与 RMCS 卡车配合使用,对观察清单上的储罐进行岩心取样,是可燃气体探测器系统的一部分。在上周,特性分析项目操作 (CPO) 技术人员按照维护程序对传感器进行了季度校准。校准结果不一致,而且传感器未能满足响应时间校准要求,因此得出结论,该设备无法在低环境温度下可靠地执行安全功能。氢气传感器是一个电化学电池,用于在被采样储罐发生氢气泄漏时触发警报并关闭 RMCS 系统。该传感器与油罐区标准氢气监测系统 (SHMS) 柜中使用的传感器属于同一供应商和类别。不过,标准氢气监测系统箱体是受气候控制的,而 RMCS 应用则没有为传感器提供受气候控制的外壳。RMCS 排气装置可燃气体检测仪需要在低至零下 20 华氏度的室外温度下工作。氢气传感器是排气装置可燃气体检测仪中两个独立传感器之一。另一个传感器没有出现这些校准问题。推入式岩心取样不需要可燃气体检测仪。在进一步调查 RMCS 排气器氢气检测器系统时,发现了低压差变送器应用中的不足。低压差变送器可用于 1 类 1 分区 B 组环境。根据供应商目录,变送器的额定输入电压为 12 至 36 伏。但是,在审查测试报告的过程中发现,要在 1 类 1 分区 B 组环境中合格使用,变送器必须以特定的方式进行配置。这种配置在控制图纸中有所规定,要求 ""相关设备 ""必须提供不超过 20 伏的电压。然而,排气装置氢气检测器系统中使用的本质安全变送器供电装置允许的最大开路电压为 28 伏。鉴定设备工程部得出结论,这种情况可能导致不符合《国家电气规范》第 504 条和 ANSI/ISA-RP12 的本质安全要求。6 ""危险（分类）场所本质安全系统的安装""。"".造成这些缺陷的直接原因是设计不当。功能设计标准要求系统在 -20°F 至 115°F 的环境中运行。虽然电池的供应商规格要求工作温度为华氏 70 度至 120 度,但系统设计没有为电池提供热保护。","None

If so, facilities should conduct a detailed hazard analysis to determine the risk of valve failure. Detailed internal inspections may be necessary in order to identify high-risk valves. Facilities should consider replacing high-risk valves at the earliest opportunity with a blow-out-resistant design. If immediate valve replacement is impossible or impractical, facilities should consider immediately modifying the valves to prevent shaft blow-out. Valve manufacturers should be consulted in order to ensure that any modifications are safe.A web-based resource developed by Sandia National Laboratories to provide data on hydrogen embrittlement of various materials is available at Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials.
设备应检查其工艺系统,以确定是否安装了可能存在这种危险的阀门。如果有,则应进行详细的危害评估。","Several workers sustained minor injuries and millions of dollars worth of equipment was damaged by an explosion after a shaft blew out of a check valve. The valve failure rapidly released a large vapor cloud of hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases which subsequently ignited.Certain types of check and butterfly valves can undergo shaft-disk separation and fail catastrophically or ""blow-out,"" causing toxic and/or flammable gas releases, fires, and vapor cloud explosions. Such failures can occur even when the valves are operated within their design limits of pressure and temperature. Most modern valve designs incorporate features that reduce or eliminate the possibility of shaft blow-out. However, older design check and butterfly valves, especially those with external appendages such as pneumatic-cylinders, counterweights, manual operators, or dashpots, may be subject to this hazard.A number of design and operational factors may contribute to this hazard. The valve has a shaft or stem piece which penetrates the pressure boundary and ends inside the pressurized portion of the valve. This feature results in an unbalanced axial thrust on the shaft which tends to force it (if unconstrained) out of the valve. The valve contains potential internal failure points, such as shaft dowel-pins, keys, or bolts such that shaft-disk separation can occur inside the valve. The dimensions and manufacturing tolerances of critical internal parts (e.g., keys, keyways, pins, and pin holes) as designed or as fabricated cause these parts to carry abnormally high loads. In this incident, the dowel pin rather than the key transmitted torque from the shaft to the disk. The valve stem or shaft is not blow-out resistant.Two-piece valve stems (""stub shafts"") that penetrate the pressure boundary (resulting in a differential pressure and unbalanced axial thrust as described above), single-diameter valve shafts (i.e., shafts with internal diameters smaller than the diameters of their packing glands), or shafts without thrust-retaining devices (such as split-ring annular thrust retainers) are susceptible to blow-out. These valves are subject to high cyclic loads. In many incidents, the valve repeatedly slammed shut with great force during compressor trips and shutdowns. Such repeated high stresses may causes propagation of intergranular cracks in critical internal components, such as dowel pins. The valve is subject to low or unsteady flow conditions, such that disk flutter or chatter occur, resulting in increased wear of keys, dowel pins, or other critical internal components.Valves in high-pressure service lines may be more likely to undergo shaft blow-out. In this incident, system pressure at the failure point was approximately 300 psig. Valves used in hydrogen-rich or hydrogen sulfide-containing environments may be more susceptible to blow-out due to hydrogen embrittlement of critical internal components, particularly if these are made from hardened steel (as was the dowel pin in this incident).
一个止回阀的轴被炸出,几名工人受轻伤,价值数百万美元的设备被爆炸损坏。阀门故障迅速释放出大量氢气和碳氢化合物气体蒸汽云,随后被点燃。某些类型的止回阀和蝶阀可能会发生轴盘分离和灾难性故障或 ""炸裂"",导致有毒和/或可燃气体释放,火灾和蒸汽云爆炸。即使阀门在其设计的压力和温度范围内运行,也可能发生此类故障。大多数现代阀门设计都具有减少或消除轴爆的可能性的功能。但是,老式设计的止回阀和蝶阀,尤其是带有气动缸,配重,手动操作器或仪表盘等外部附件的止回阀和蝶阀,可能会有这种危险。许多设计和操作因素都可能导致这种危险。阀门的轴或阀杆穿过压力边界,末端位于阀门的受压部分内。这一特点会导致轴受到不平衡的轴向推力,从而迫使轴（如果不受约束）离开阀门。阀门包含潜在的内部故障点,如轴销,键或螺栓,从而可能在阀门内部发生轴盘分离。关键内部零件（如键,键槽,销和销孔）的设计或制造尺寸和制造公差会导致这些零件承受异常高的载荷。在这起事故中,是销钉而不是键将扭矩从轴传递到阀盘。阀杆或阀轴不具有抗爆性。穿透压力边界（导致上述压差和不平衡轴向推力）的两件式阀杆（""短轴""）,单直径阀轴（即内径小于其填料腺直径的轴）或没有止推装置（如分瓣环形止推装置）的轴很容易发生井喷。这些阀门承受着很高的循环载荷。在许多事故中,在压缩机跳闸和停机期间,阀门反复以很大的力关闭。这种反复的高应力可能会导致关键内部部件（如销钉）出现晶间裂纹。阀门在低流量或不稳定的流量条件下会出现盘面跳动或颤动,从而导致键,销轴或其他关键内部组件的磨损加剧。高压服务管路中的阀门可能更容易发生轴冲出。在此事件中,故障点的系统压力约为 300 psig。在富氢或含硫化氢环境中使用的阀门可能更容易因内部关键部件的氢脆而爆裂,特别是如果这些部件是由硬化钢制成的（如本次事故中的销钉）。","None

The primary lesson learned from this occurrence is that personnel must be cognizant of the impact of their actions on other shifts. Planning with thought on potential consequences is necessary to ensure work activities are performed safely and the appropriate actions are taken as required.
这种情况突出表明,必须确保以务实高效的方式组织和规划工作。从这次事故中吸取的主要教训是,工作人员必须认识到他们的行动对其他班次的影响。制定计划时必须考虑到潜在的后果,以确保工作活动安全进行,并按要求采取适当的行动。","An operator went to purge a process tank per standard operating procedure. The operator reviewed the previous shift's purge time and determined the next required purge time. The operator found that the tank had been purged earlier than expected on the previous shift. Because the earlier purge time was not recognized, the 12-hour purge frequency was exceeded.

Background: On the previous day, during the night shift, an operator performed 12-hour hydrogen purges per the requirements of the standard operating procedure. Each of the hydrogen purges was completed within the required time limits. The operator correctly recorded the time and date that the next hydrogen purges would be required. The following morning, shift turnover was conducted. The direct and root cause of this occurrence is a management problem, work organization / planning deficiency. On 8/26/00, during the night shift, the 12-hour hydrogen purge was performed unusually early in the shift (19:10 hours to 19:15 hours) to accommodate other scheduled work activities. Performing the purge this early in the shift resulted in the next purge being required by 07:15 hours, immediately after morning shift change turnover, which usually occurs at approximately 07:00 hours. Poor planning led to the operator not purging one of the process vessels within the required 12-hour frequency. The operator that completed the procedure and performed the vessel hydrogen purge is qualified and routinely successfully performs these evolutions without error.

The night shift manager should have recognized that it would be difficult to meet the 12-hour purge frequency the following morning. The manager should have scheduled the hydrogen purge for later in the shift, or again prior to the end of the night shift so that it could reasonably be performed on the next shift.
一名操作员按照标准操作程序去清洗一个加工罐。操作员查看了上一班的清洗时间,并确定了下一班所需的清洗时间。操作员发现上一班的清洗时间早于预期时间。由于没有确认较早的清洗时间,因此超过了 12 小时的清洗频率。

背景： 前一天夜班时,一名操作员按照标准操作程序的要求进行了 12 小时氢气吹扫。每次氢气吹扫都在规定时限内完成。操作员正确记录了需要进行下一次氢气吹扫的时间和日期。第二天早上,进行了交接班。这次事故的直接和根本原因是管理问题,工作组织/计划缺陷。2000 年 8 月 26 日,在夜班期间,12 小时氢气吹扫异常提前（19:10 至 19:15）进行,以适应其他预定的工作活动。由于在当班时间过早进行氢气吹扫,导致下一次氢气吹扫需要在 7:15 时之前进行,即在早上交接班后立即进行,而交接班通常在 7:00 时左右进行。由于计划不周,操作员未能在规定的 12 小时频率内清洗其中一个工艺容器。完成该程序并进行容器氢气吹扫的操作员是合格的,并定期成功地进行这些演练,不会出错。

夜班经理本应认识到很难在第二天早上达到 12 小时的清洗频率。该经理应将氢气吹扫安排在当班的晚些时候,或在夜班结束前再次进行,以便下一班可以合理地进行吹扫。","None

The affected valve is a one-half inch polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ball valve. The valve has an extension shaft coupled to the valve body, and the valve handle is coupled to the extension shaft, allowing the valve to be operated outside the process panel cover. The valve stem is cross-drilled and the extension shaft is pinned through the stem.

With this occurrence, engineering evaluated the one-half inch PVC ball valve design, and redesigned the extension rod and handle, which will be installed when the affected valve is replaced. The redesign will allow replacement of the extension rod and handle without requiring removal of the valve itself. The redesigned extension and valve handle will apply lower operating stresses to the valve stem, minimizing the likelihood of recurrence.

Since additional workers were available, the craft supervisor decided to re-enter the viewing room pipe trench to remove pipe. A pre-job briefing on the planned work included a discussion with the demolition technician of the previous hydrogen gas testing results. During this pipe-cutting activity, the craft supervisor directed the removal of the No. 2 pipe that had not yet undergone the follow-up hydrogen gas testing.

A fire followed the explosion, but was rapidly extinguished by staff using fire extinguishers prior to the arrival of fire service personnel. The pressure wave from the explosion blew windows out of the laboratory, with glass hitting a passerby on a path outside and glass shards landing up to 30 m away. Ceiling panels were dislodged in the laboratory and adjacent rooms, and a worker using the apparatus at the time was taken to the hospital by ambulance for burn treatment. The worker subsequently fully recovered. Another worker in the lab at the time required medical observation, but was otherwise unharmed.

Mixtures of inert gases and hydrogen are routinely used in the type of anaerobic chamber involved in the incident. The mixtures used in the chamber involved were produced locally in the laboratory using nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. The hydrogen in the mixture reacts with any oxygen present in the chamber, on a heated catalyst, to eliminate oxygen and keep the chamber anaerobic. The local operating procedures used in the lab allowed high concentrations of hydrogen to be introduced into the chamber. A worker inadvertently admitted air to the chamber while doing maintenance, allowing the hydrogen-enriched atmosphere in the chamber to mix with air and subsequently ignite, most likely on contact with the oxidation catalyst in the chamber, resulting in the explosion and fire.

Hydrogen gas has a very wide range of flammability when mixed with air (4–75%). Oxidation catalysts can ignite explosive gas mixes without heating, spark, or flame. Local operating procedures and practices varied from the manufacturer’s advice. An unknown concentration of hydrogen was present in the chamber, resulting in a significant fire and explosion risk.

惰性气体和氢气的混合物通常用于事故中涉及的厌氧室。实验室使用氮气,二氧化碳和氢气就地生产出了涉事厌氧室中使用的混合物。混合物中的氢气在加热催化剂的作用下与舱内的任何氧气发生反应,从而消除氧气,保持舱内厌氧状态。实验室使用的本地操作程序允许将高浓度氢气引入试验室。一名工人在进行维护时不慎将空气带入燃烧室,使燃烧室中的富氢气氛与空气混合,随后被点燃,很可能是与燃烧室中的氧化催化剂接触,导致爆炸和火灾。

氢气与空气混合后的可燃性范围很广（4-75%）。氧化催化剂可以在不加热,不产生火花或火焰的情况下点燃爆炸性混合气体。当地的操作程序和做法与制造商的建议不同。试验室中存在未知浓度的氢气,导致重大火灾和爆炸风险。","None

In this incident, the heater controller was defective so the heating element was disconnected from the controller and plugged directly into a wall outlet. This situation allowed the oven to reach temperatures in excess of 400 °C within 20 minutes. While the temperature increased, the decaborane continued to expand, causing a significant pressure build-up within the oven. The pressure increase eventually caused the oven's viewing window to burst. A burst of burning hydrogen was emitted from the window and burned the face of a researcher who was hospitalized for approximately three weeks.

运行期间","Although most of the hydrogen fluoride piping system was open to the atmosphere before the elbow was cut, the lines were not purged. Two plugs of residual material on either side of the elbow remained in place, thus allowing hydrogen to be trapped in the elbow. In the future, piping systems containing hydrogen fluoride or other chemicals should be purged to ensure that they are free from hazards prior to starting D&amp;D activities.
虽然在弯头被切断之前,大部分氟化氢管道系统都是通向大气的,但管线并没有被净化。弯头两侧的两个残留材料塞子仍在原处,从而使氢气被截留在弯头中。今后,含有氟化氢或其他化学品的管道系统应在开始 D&amp;D 活动之前进行净化,以确保其不存在危险。","A subcontractor employee was using a band saw to cut a 1"" metal pipe when a flash fire occurred on the third floor hydrogen fluoride area. Subcontractor employees were removing all piping associated with the Anhydrous Hydrofluoric Acid (AHF) system. These lines were being removed during plant decontamination and demolition (D&amp;D). The subcontractor employee was attempting to cut a 90-degree elbow located at the highest elevation on the 1"" line, but the lowest elevation of the overall piping run. Since hydrogen is lighter than air, it is speculated that a minute amount of hydrogen gas had accumulated in the elbow.

Even though Safe Shutdown personnel had previously opened the system and placed it in a safe configuration, residual hydrogen fluoride could have still reacted with the metal piping to create hydrogen gas. The subcontractor employee began to cut the elbow with a portable electric band saw. Once the heat generated by the band saw came into contact with the hydrogen gas, an extremely rapid exothermic chemical reaction with a resulting flash fire occurred. There was no significant impact to on-site or off-site personnel as a result of this occurrence.

The subcontractor employee performing the cutting immediately walked to the temporary safety shower, located less than 15 feet away, and thoroughly rinsed his chemical resistant personal protective equipment (PPE). A second employee readied a fire extinguisher, also less than 15 feet away, but it was never discharged due to the short duration of the event. The first employee left the temporary shower, doffed the outer set of anti-c's, and proceeded to the decontamination area. Upon arrival at the decontamination area, the employee doffed his inner set of anti-c's and showered a second time for twenty minutes as a safety precaution.

The employee exhibited no physical injuries, but was sent to medical for verification. The employee had been wearing cotton anti-contamination clothing and a second set of chemical resistant anti-c's. The flash fire caused the chemical-resistant clothing to melt, similar to a marshmallow, on the right side of the employee's body. The cotton anti-c's located underneath the chemical resistant anti-c's revealed no physical signs of heat damage as a result of the flash fire, most likely due to the employee's quick activation of the safety shower and/or short duration of the event.

The root cause of the event was determined to be a defective or inadequate procedure. The facility did not identify hydrogen off-gas as a potential hazard in the hydrogen fluoride process lines of the plant. If this issue had been properly addressed, it is less likely that this event would have occurred.
一名分包商雇员在使用带锯切割一根 1 英寸金属管时,三楼氟化氢区域发生闪火。分包商员工当时正在拆除与无水氢氟酸 (AHF) 系统相关的所有管道。这些管道是在工厂净化和拆除 (D&amp;D) 过程中拆除的。分包商员工试图切割一个 90 度弯头,该弯头位于 1 英寸管线的最高处,但却是整个管线的最低处。由于氢气比空气轻,因此推测弯头中积聚了少量氢气。

尽管安全停机人员之前已打开系统并将其置于安全配置中,但残留的氟化氢仍可能与金属管道发生反应,产生氢气。分包商员工开始用便携式电动带锯切割弯头。一旦带锯产生的热量与氢气接触,就会发生极其迅速的放热化学反应,从而引发闪火。这次事故没有对现场或场外人员造成重大影响。

进行切割的分包商雇员立即走到不到 15 英尺外的临时安全淋浴处,彻底冲洗了他的防化学个人防护设备 (PPE)。另一名员工也在不到 15 英尺的地方准备了一个灭火器,但由于事件发生的时间很短,灭火器一直没有出水。第一名员工离开临时淋浴间,脱下外层防化服,前往消除污染区。到达净化区后,该员工脱掉了内层防毒面具,并作为安全措施进行了 20 分钟的第二次淋浴。

该员工未表现出身体受伤,但被送往医疗机构进行核实。该员工一直穿着棉质防污服和第二套防化服。闪火导致该员工身体右侧的防化服融化,就像棉花糖一样。位于防化服下面的棉质防化服没有显示出因闪火而受热损坏的物理迹象,这很可能是因为该员工迅速启动了安全淋浴和/或事件持续时间较短。

事件的根本原因被确定为程序存在缺陷或不足。该工厂没有将氢气废气确定为工厂氟化氢工艺管线中的潜在危险。如果这个问题得到了妥善解决,就不太可能发生此次事件。","Band saw

The leak was on the hydrogen dryer inside a shack attached to a building. The leak vented 200 psig hydrogen into the shack. The hydrogen low-pressure alarm sounded. No furnace operators were present at the time. An estimated 10,000 standard cubic feet of hydrogen vented. T

he hydrogen release was caused by a failure of an elastomeric pressure seal on the body of a particulate filter located in the hydrogen supply circuit of the Pit Furnace. After a similar event a month earlier, the cause was identified as a simple seal failure; however an independent engineering review after the present incident showed the cause to be system overpressure, caused by regulator failure.

氢气泄漏的原因是位于井式炉氢气供应回路中的微粒过滤器本体上的弹性压力密封失效。在一个月前的一次类似事件后,原因被确定为简单的密封失效；但在这次事件后进行的独立工程审查表明,原因是调节器失效造成的系统超压。","None

While this now has been determined, the previous form(s) of this system, associated documentation, and accident history did not provide sufficient basis to assume continued safe operation. The review of furnace operation subsequent to this accident now provides a basis to evaluate the safe operation of furnace #4 as well as other similar facilities.The failure to apply the appropriate procedure suggests the need for either additional administrative controls and/or periodic refresher training.
吸取的主要教训是,事故发生时的活性氢设施和现有操作程序是合理的。虽然现在已经确定了这一点,但该系统以前的形式,相关文件和事故历史并没有为假定持续安全运行提供足够的依据。事故发生后对熔炉运行情况的审查为评估 4 号熔炉及其他类似设施的安全运行情况提供了依据。未能采用适当的程序表明,有必要采取额外的行政控制措施和/或定期复习培训。","A brazing retort in a shop malfunctioned and resulted in an explosion that propelled the retort shell to the roof of the brazing area and then back to the floor. There were no injuries but damage was sustained by the furnace housing and the retort shell.

Administrative personnel were soon on the scene to make a preliminary assessment of the situation. An expert safety team was retained to assist in the investigation of the explosion. The safety team conducted their initial field investigation on the afternoon of the explosion and again on the following day.

Once it was determined that the explosion was the result of an ignition of a flammable mixture of hydrogen and air, the next step was to determine how air ended up in the retort, given that the retort is nominally pumped down to 28 inches Hg vacuum, and back filled with a positive pressure of nitrogen before the hydrogen is introduced.

A number of potential mechanical/physical possibilities for the presence of air in the retort were considered and eventually rejected. A careful study of the metallic structures involved showed no leaks or cracks that could account for air in the system. Detailed examination by safety specialists ruled out both o-ring and ceramic vacuum seal failure. Tests on the hydrogen and nitrogen storage tanks and their respective piping network to the shop proper showed no flaws within these systems, thereby eliminating the possibility that a leak could have introduced air into the retort system. When the vacuum gage at the inlet to the retort was found to be operating properly, the safety team had eliminated the last of the mechanical/physical possibilities for the air in the system that led to the explosion.

At this juncture the safety team turned its attention to two non- mechanical/physical possibilities for the explosion, i.e., either the written procedure to be used with hydrogen retorts is badly flawed, or the operator failed to follow the procedure. A series of tests showed the procedure itself to be sound (actually allowing for a ""robust"" level of safety, according to the FaAA findings), so operator failure to follow procedures became the focal point of investigation. Further analysis clearly indicated that the cause of the explosion was the failure of the operator to effectively evacuate the retort and backfill with nitrogen, combined with a hydrogen purge far short of the specified 20 minutes at 50 SCFH.
一个车间的钎焊炉发生故障,导致爆炸,钎焊炉外壳被推到钎焊区的屋顶,然后又落回地面。没有人员伤亡,但熔炉外壳和甑壳受到损坏。

管理人员很快赶到现场,对情况进行了初步评估。一个专家安全小组受聘协助调查爆炸事件。安全小组在爆炸当天下午进行了初步的现场调查,并在第二天再次进行了调查。

一旦确定爆炸是由氢气和空气的易燃混合物点燃引起的,下一步就是确定空气是如何进入蒸馏罐的,因为蒸馏罐名义上是抽到 28 英寸汞柱的真空,并在引入氢气之前回充正压氮气。

我们考虑了在蒸馏罐中存在空气的一些潜在的机械/物理可能性,但最终都被否决了。对相关金属结构的仔细研究表明,系统中没有可能存在空气的泄漏或裂缝。安全专家的详细检查排除了 O 形圈和陶瓷真空密封失效的可能性。对氢气和氮气储罐及其各自通往车间的管道网络进行的测试表明,这些系统内部没有任何缺陷,因此排除了泄漏将空气引入蒸馏罐系统的可能性。当发现蒸馏罐入口处的真空计工作正常时,安全小组排除了系统中空气导致爆炸的最后一种机械/物理可能性。

此时,安全小组将注意力转向了两种非机械/物理的爆炸可能性,即氢气蒸馏罐的书面使用程序存在严重缺陷,或者操作员没有遵守程序。一系列测试表明,程序本身是合理的（根据 FaAA 的调查结果,实际上可以达到 ""稳健 ""的安全水平）,因此,操作员未遵守程序成为调查的重点。进一步的分析清楚地表明,爆炸的原因是操作员未能有效地排空蒸馏罐并用氮气回填,再加上氢气吹扫的时间远远低于规定的 20 分钟 50 SCFH。","None

The requirement was that an unused hydrogen gas cylinder adjacent to the building and not connected to a manifold be removed prior to the use of propane tanks for the hot tar portion of the work.

The project manager failed to remove the extra gas bottle as required because he did not recognize from the bottle color and lack of stencil that the bottle contained hydrogen.

An explicit checklist containing all the administrative controls and requiring careful inspection was not available at the time of the inspection. The checklist preparation also would have made obvious the fact that administrative controls had been established. The project manager paid insufficient attention to his inspection and did not notice that the extra gas bottle had a tag attached identifying its contents. Unlike the adjacent bottle that was connected to the manifold and therefore acceptable, the extra bottle was painted red only at the top and lacked the identifying stencil ""HYDROGEN"".

The root cause was that management did not require a consolidated checklist based on the controls identified by the facility as a part of the work planning and organization process and assure that the controls were in place prior to commencing the work.

The calibration required a break on a hydrogen line in order to install a Measuring and Test Equipment (M&amp;TE) gage, which was used in the calibration. At the time the operator was informed of the calibration, the cleaning run procedure had been initiated but the actual cleaning had not yet begun. A discussion between his supervisor and the facility maintenance coordinator resulted in a decision to proceed with the maintenance task and suspend the cleaning run until afterwards.

The operator evacuated the hydrogen line and the hydrogen cylinder was valved out. The maintenance work package procedure had been revised at an earlier date to allow the maintenance task to be performed without employing Hazardous Energy Control (HEC), which would have involved a single point worker lockout for isolation of the hydrogen cylinder. Although employment of HEC alone would not have prevented the incident, the lack of this control was identified during the incident review as an adverse impact to overall worker safety. Corrective actions pertinent to HEC documentation are also being tracked but are separate from the corrective actions identified under this occurrence report.

After the hydrogen cylinder was valved out, the maintenance workers made the line break at the M&amp;TE test port on the hydrogen line, and installed the M&amp;TE. This introduced room atmosphere air into the line and volume vessel. The hydrogen bottle was then valved in to perform the necessary calibration in incremental steps. After the calibration was completed, the M&amp;TE was removed from the test port, allowing the line and volume gas to backfill with room atmosphere air again. The test port plug was reinstalled and the operator evacuated the contents from the hydrogen line, but not the volume vessel. The maintenance work package did not specify the correct Post Maintenance Test (PMT) which would have included system restoration using a specific operations procedure. This procedure directs the evacuation of the volume and sampling of the system prior to resuming a cleaning run, neither of which were performed.

The cleaning run resumed, and the operator did not receive the expected response on some of the process parameters during the run. He then asked for assistance from technical support personnel in evaluating the abnormalities. Technical personnel recommended sampling of the system contents. The initial sample came back with the oxygen level being above our procedural limit for a flammable mix. Second and third samples showed that a flammable mix did not exist. An initial critique was held to address the potential flammable mix issues. During this critique, evaluation of the events indicated that the work control process was not adequate prior to and after the maintenance task, and Conduct of Operations practices were weak. Due to this additional information, a second critique was held. Additional corrective actions were identified.
一名操作员开始准备清洁工作,却不知道当天上午还安排了校准压力传感器的维护任务。校准工作需要中断氢气管线,以便安装校准中使用的测量和测试设备 (M&amp;TE) 量具。操作员接到校准通知时,清洁运行程序已经启动,但实际清洁工作尚未开始。操作员的上司与设备维护协调员讨论后决定继续执行维护任务,并暂停清洁运行,直至清洁运行结束。

操作员抽空了氢气管线,并将氢气瓶的阀门关闭。维护工作包程序在早些时候进行了修订,允许在不采用危险能量控制（HEC）的情况下执行维护任务,这将涉及到单点工人锁定以隔离氢气瓶。虽然仅采用危险能量控制（HEC）并不能防止事故的发生,但在事故审查期间,缺乏这种控制被认定为对整体工人安全的不利影响。与 HEC 文件有关的纠正措施也在跟踪之中,但与本事故报告中确定的纠正措施是分开的。氢气瓶阀门关闭后,维修工人在氢气管线上的 M&amp;TE 测试口处断开管线,并安装 M&amp;TE。这将室内空气引入管路和容积容器。然后将氢气瓶阀门打开,以逐步进行必要的校准。校准完成后,从测试端口移除 M&amp;TE,让管路和容积气体重新充满室温空气。重新安装测试端口插头,操作员排空氢气管线中的内容物,但不排空容积容器中的内容物。维护工作包没有规定正确的维护后测试 (PMT),这包括使用特定的操作程序恢复系统。该程序要求在恢复清洁运行之前排空容积容器并对系统取样,但这两项工作都没有进行。

清洗运行恢复后,操作员在运行过程中没有收到对某些工艺参数的预期响应。于是,他请求技术支持人员协助评估异常情况。技术人员建议对系统内容物进行取样。首次取样结果显示,氧气含量超过了易燃混合物的程序限值。第二和第三个样本显示不存在易燃混合物。为解决潜在的易燃混合物问题,举行了一次初步批评会。在这次审查中,对事件的评估表明,在维修任务之前和之后的工作控制流程不够充分,而且 ""作业行为 ""实践薄弱。根据这些补充信息,进行了第二次审查。确定了更多的纠正措施。","None

The work scope for the shift would be dedicated to continued fabrication of designed tubing runs, repairs to existing tubing with known leaks and pressure testing of other various tubing runs. The shift craft complement would include three pipe fitters, one welder, one QC inspector and a shift supervisor.

The shift remained under normal operations prior to the event. There had been no existing problem up until the point that craft personnel implemented some hydrostatic pressure testing on some tubing runs on the spare hydrogen mitigation pump. Work activities associated with the hydrostatic testing were to be in accordance with the Hydrostatic Test Procedure. This activity was initiated at approximately 9:00 p.m.. After initial pressurization of a tubing run, an indicated pressure of about 5200-5300 P.S.I., the pipe fitters realized that they were unable to maintain the required test pressure of 5000 P.S.I.+. Immediate trouble-shooting of the 3/8"" stainless steel tubing (.065"" wall thickness) run revealed a leak near the far end of the run at the Swagelok fitting and cap. At this point, the time was estimated to be approximate (9:40 p.m.)

At approximately 9:50 p.m., the pipe fitters commenced removing the cap from the Swagelok fitting at the far end of the run. At this time, it was apparent (as later stated by several of the pipe fitters) that they believed the balance of the tubing run to have been bled off and not to be under pressure. They had not recognized that the portion of the tubing run down stream of the check valves and the Swagelok fitting had remained isolated, therefore, remaining under high pressure. When the pipe fitter loosened the cap off of the tubing run Swagelok, the Swagelok, ferrules, and cap still under extreme pressure, blew off the end of the tubing run, becoming an airborne projectile. The pipe fitter that was performing the work stated that the force from the tubing run was strong enough that it blew his hands back away from the area near the Swagelok fitting. Information to date is inconclusive as to ""how far"" the Swagelok did or did not travel or at what velocity it was traveling, but subsequent inquiries directly related to this event have classified this as a near miss. No one was standing in front of the tube run and no one was injured.

Swagelok™ fittings, should not be tampered with, loosened or removed while under extreme pressure for any reason. In this case, the fitting was loosened to relieve pressure in lieu of a non-existent vent valve.
车间主管认为有必要换第二班来完成备用氢气缓解泵的一些优先工作。该班次的工作范围将专门用于继续制造设计的管路,修理已知泄漏的现有管路以及对其他各种管路进行压力测试。当班的工艺人员包括三名管道安装工,一名焊工,一名质量控制检查员和一名班长。

事件发生前,该班次仍在正常运行。在工艺人员对备用氢气缓解泵上的一些管道进行静水压力测试之前,一直没有出现任何问题。与静水压力测试相关的工作活动应符合静水压力测试程序。在对管道进行初步加压后,显示压力约为 5200-5300 P. S. I. ,管道安装工意识到他们无法维持所需的 5000 P. S. I. + 的测试压力。立即对 3/8"" 不锈钢卡套管（壁厚 065""）进行故障排查,发现卡套管远端的世伟洛克接头和管帽处有泄漏。此时,估计时间大约是晚上 9:40 分。

大约晚上 9:50 随后,管道安装工开始拆除管道远端的世伟洛克接头的盖子。此时,很明显（正如几名管道安装工后来所说的那样）,他们认为管路的其余部分已经放气,没有压力。他们没有意识到,单向阀和世伟洛克接头下游的那部分管路仍然处于隔离状态,因此仍然处于高压之下。当配管工松开世伟洛克卡套管的盖子时,世伟洛克卡套管,卡套和盖子仍然处于极高的压力下,从卡套管的末端炸开,成为空气中的弹丸。当时正在施工的管道安装工说,卡套管运行时产生的力量非常大,把他的手从世伟洛克接头附近吹了回来。迄今为止,关于世伟洛克 ""飞出多远 ""或 ""飞出多快 ""的信息尚无定论,但与此事件直接相关的后续调查已将此事件归类为 ""险情""。没有人站在管线前,也没有人受伤。

无论出于何种原因,都不得在极压状态下篡改,松动或拆卸世伟洛克™接头。在这种情况下,松开接头是为了释放压力,以代替并不存在的排气阀。","None

The student extinguished the fire with the fire extinguisher, then left the building with the other occupants.

Members of the onsite fire department responded and entered the building at 16:04. They noted the absence of smoke in the hallways, dissipating smoke in the lab and no apparent flames. The Hazardous Materials Response Team was assembled to develop a plan for mitigation. Building occupants were escorted back into the building to power down critical experiments and at 18:00 all occupants were given the opportunity to re-enter the building to collect personal items and leave for the day. At 19:20, the Hazardous Materials Response Team entered the laboratory to execute the mitigation plan, removing the materials from the area and wiping down the area with mineral oil. There were no injuries resulting from this event.

这一事件突出表明,有必要确保执行特殊程序不会使设施设备处于可能导致进入 LCO 的状态。","As a prerequisite to a storage tank slurry pump run, a tank operator identified a Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) Analyzer surveillance reading to the control room that was out of limits low. The reading was a negative zero % LFL indication (-0 % LFL). The tank operator roundsheet limits are 0 to 10% LFL. The ""null"" value (value read on analyzer when air with 0% LFL is drawn through the analyzer) as directed by the LFL Analyzer loop calibration procedure is set between 0 and 4% LFL.

To alert personnel to the buildup of potentially dangerous levels of explosive gases in the tank, a Combustible Gas Detection System is used to monitor and analyze sample air drawn from the tank vapor space. This system consists of a sensing element, a 4-20 milliAmp direct current (mADC) output transmitter and a single channel controller. The indicating range of this unit is 0-100% LFL indication which corresponds to 0-100% of span and 4-20 mADC transmitter output.

A review of vendor documentation found that the tank analyzer transmitter output can be affected by ambient temperature changes. The manufacturer specifies a zero shift of 0.02% LFL indication per degree celsius change. Vendor documents also stated that a transmitter output signal of less than four milliamps (+/- 2%) is displayed as a negative % LFL reading. (Whenever the transmitter output is less than 4.05 mADC, it is displayed as a negative % LFL indication.)

The tank LFL Analyzer sensor and transmitter are located in an insulated cabinet in which the temperature is controlled at a nominal 37.8 degrees celsius. When the analyzer ""null"" value was adjusted to correspond to a 4.091 mADC transmitter output, the cabinet doors were open. With the cabinet doors open, the transmitter was subjected to the ambient outside temperature, which at that time was approximately 22.8 degrees celsius. When the negative zero indication was reported, the cabinet doors were closed and the cabinet temperature was being controlled at 37.8 degrees celsius. Due to the specified zero shift per degree celsius change, the 15 degree change in temperature resulted in the transmitter milliamp output decreasing enough to cause a negative zero meter indication.
作为储罐泥浆泵运行的先决条件,储罐操作员向控制室确认了可燃性下限 (LFL) 分析仪的监控读数超出了低限。读数为负 0 % LFL 指示（-0 % LFL）。储罐操作员的巡视表限值为 0 至 10% LFL。根据 LFL 分析仪循环校准程序的指示,""空 ""值（当 LFL 为 0% 的空气通过分析仪时,在分析仪上读取的值）设置在 0 至 4% LFL 之间。

为了提醒工作人员注意储罐中潜在危险水平的爆炸性气体的积累,使用了可燃气体检测系统来监测和分析从储罐蒸汽空间抽取的空气样本。该系统由一个传感元件,一个 4-20 毫安直流 (mADC) 输出变送器和一个单通道控制器组成。该装置的指示范围为 0-100% LFL 指示,对应于 0-100% 的量程和 4-20 毫安直流电 (mADC) 发送器输出。

对供应商文件的审查发现,油箱分析仪变送器的输出会受到环境温度变化的影响。制造商规定,每摄氏度变化,零点偏移为 0.02% LFL 指示。供应商文件还指出,发射机输出信号小于 4 毫安（+/- 2%）时,显示为负的 LFL 百分比读数。(只要发射机输出低于 4 毫安（+/- 2%）,则显示为负的 LFL % 读数。05 mADC,则显示为负的 LFL % 指示。).

储罐 LFL 分析仪传感器和发射器位于一个隔热柜中,柜内温度控制在标称 37. 8 摄氏度。当分析仪的 ""空 ""值被调整到与 4.091 mADC 发送机输出相对应时,柜门是打开的。在柜门打开的情况下,发射机受到室外环境温度的影响,当时室外环境温度约为 22. 8 摄氏度。当报告负零指示时,机柜门关闭,机柜温度控制在 37. 8 摄氏度。由于每摄氏度变化都有指定的零点偏移,15 度的温度变化导致发射机毫安输出下降,足以引起负零点仪表指示。","None

这起事故是由于采样线监测系统受潮造成的。清除采样管路中的水分可提高设备的可靠性。目前正在考虑进一步评估,以提高系统的可靠性。","A waste pretreatment tank operator was performing surveillance rounds on a tank and found the Composite Lower Flammability Limit (CLFL) Analyzer sample flow reading 1.4 cubic feet per hour (CFH). The Operational Safety Requirements (OSR) document required flow range is 1.5 CFH to 2.5 CFH. The Limiting Condition for Operation was immediately entered and the tank operator adjusted the flow into the required surveillance range.

The hydrogen and CLFL monitors are used to detect the presence of flammable gases in waste tanks vapor space. Maintaining the concentration of flammable vapors in the tank vapor space below flammability limits maintains tank integrity by preventing the possibility of tank deflagrations. The hydrogen monitors provide an automatic means to monitor flammable gas concentrations in waste tanks. They indicate % LFL locally in the respective tank valve houses, remotely in the control room Distributed Control System (DCS) console, and have alarm capability for certain conditions.

Later that day, the tank operator found the tank CLFL analyzer reading out of limits and the shift manager immediately entered a LCO, which included terminating the tank to waste transfer and allowing the tank operator to adjust sample flow. However, sample flow could not be adjusted within roundsheet limits. At 0945 hours, the tank operator obtained tank vapor space sample results using the alternate monitor (sample results reading was zero % LFL).

As a result of the investigation, the direct and root causes were attributed to ""Equipment/Material Problem; Contaminant"" - moisture in the sample line. Moisture comes from the waste tank vapor space and affects the operability of the CLFL analyzer. As moisture accumulates in the sample line, the operators are directed by the surveillance roundsheets to blow down the monitoring system. The tank to tank transfer that was in progress at the time of the occurrence contributed to the moisture in the tank vapor space, and the subsequent moisture loading of the tank CLFL sample filter.
一名废物预处理储罐操作员在对一个储罐进行监督检查时,发现复合可燃性下限 (CLFL) 分析仪的样本流量读数为 1.4 立方英尺/小时 (CFH)。操作安全要求 (OSR) 文件规定的流量范围是 1.5 立方英尺/小时至 2.5 立方英尺/小时。立即进入 ""运行限制条件"",储罐操作员将流量调整到要求的监控范围。

氢气和 CLFL 监测器用于检测废物罐蒸气空间中是否存在易燃气体。将储罐蒸汽空间中的可燃蒸汽浓度保持在可燃性限值以下,可以防止储罐爆燃,从而保持储罐的完整性。氢气监测仪提供了一种自动监测废物罐中可燃气体浓度的方法。氢气监测仪可在各储罐阀室本地显示 LFL %,在控制室分布式控制系统 (DCS) 控制台上远程显示,并可在某些情况下发出警报。

当天晚些时候,储罐操作员发现储罐 CLFL 分析仪的读数超出限值,当班经理立即输入了 LCO,其中包括终止储罐到废物的转移,并允许储罐操作员调整样品流量。然而,样品流量无法在圆表限制范围内调整。9 时 45 分,油罐操作员使用备用监测仪获得了油罐蒸汽空间样本结果（样本结果读数为零 % LFL）。

调查结果显示,直接和根本原因是 ""设备/材料问题；污染物""--样品管路中的湿气。湿气来自废物罐的蒸汽空间,影响 CLFL 分析仪的操作性。当样品管路中积聚湿气时,操作员根据监控巡视表的指示吹扫监控系统。事故发生时正在进行的储罐到储罐的转移造成了储罐蒸汽空间中的湿气,以及随后储罐 CLFL 样品过滤器中的湿气负载。","None

这种情况突出说明了适当设计,设备选择和设计审查的重要性；与其他设施共用公用设施的潜在弊端；以及尽可能简化[在本例中,手套箱大气净化设备/工艺]操作的必要性。","A facility replaced the copper tubing used for hydrogen distribution, with stainless steel tubing. This was done to address a fire protection concern related to the solder on the copper tubing being susceptible to heat, melting, and releasing a flammable gas. The facility maintenance personnel completed the replacement, noted the pressure on the hydrogen bottle, and left the building. When the maintenance person returned on the following day, s/he noticed the pressure on the hydrogen bottle had dropped 500 psi overnight, indicating a leak in the system. S/he notified the appropriate facility personnel and together they began to determine why the hydrogen had dropped 500 psi overnight. The hydrogen line originates at a manifold, which is part of a glove box atmosphere purification system that also includes an argon line. The onsite personnel experimented with the valves associated with the hydrogen and argon lines and determined that the check valve associated with the argon line was defective. As a result, the hydrogen was back flowing through the argon check valve into the argon supply line.

The direct cause of this occurrence was attributed to a failed argon check valve that allowed hydrogen to escape from the hydrogen supply manifold and enter the argon system. The contributing and root cause was identified as a design problem. The check valve installed to prevent the back flow of hydrogen into the argon system, designed to open with an upstream pressure of 1/3 psig. The product catalog states that valves with nominal cracking pressure of 8 psig or lower may require back pressure to reseal bubble-tight. The back pressure in the system was not sufficient to reseal a 1/3 psig valve. Product data suggests that a the valve, having a cracking pressure of 10 psig and not requiring back pressure to reseal, should have been chosen for this application. Also, double check valves (i.e., two check valves in series) should have been installed to provide double isolation between the two gas systems. However, it is doubtful in this case if two valves would have been adequate to prevent the backflow of hydrogen since the wrong sized valve (i.e., 1/3 psi) was initially chosen.

The hydrogen was sufficiently diluted with argon in the argon system and did not pose a safety, fire, or explosion hazard.
一家工厂用不锈钢管替换了用于氢气输送的铜管。这样做是为了解决与铜管上的焊料易受热,熔化并释放易燃气体有关的防火问题。设施维护人员完成更换后,注意到氢气瓶的压力,然后离开了大楼。第二天,当维护人员返回时,发现氢气瓶的压力一夜之间下降了 500 psi,这表明系统出现了泄漏。他（她）通知了相关设备人员,并开始一起确定氢气在一夜之间下降 500 psi 的原因。氢气管道源于一个歧管,它是手套箱气氛净化系统的一部分,该系统还包括一条氩气管道。现场人员对与氢气和氩气管路相关的阀门进行了试验,确定与氩气管路相关的止回阀存在缺陷。因此,氢气通过氩气单向阀倒流到氩气供应管路中。

发生这种情况的直接原因是氩气单向阀发生故障,导致氢气从氢气供应歧管泄漏并进入氩气系统。经查明,根本原因是设计问题。为防止氢气倒流到氩气系统而安装的止回阀,在上游压力为 1/3 psig 时打开。产品目录规定,标称开启压力为 8 psig 或更低的阀门可能需要背压才能重新密封。系统中的背压不足以重新密封 1/3 psig 的阀门。产品数据表明,这种应用应该选择开启压力为 10 psig 且不需要背压来重新密封的阀门。此外,本应安装双止回阀（即两个串联的止回阀）,在两个气体系统之间提供双重隔离。然而,在这种情况下,两个阀门是否足以防止氢气倒流令人怀疑,因为最初选择的阀门尺寸不对 （即 1/3 psi）。

The apprentice and another mechanic had raised the bus about 1 foot from the ground to position it on jack stands when the hydraulic jack tipped over. The apprentice went to the site medical facility, where he needed five stitches to close the wound in his forearm.

The mechanics were raising the rear of a hydrogen prototype bus, like the one in the figure below, and placing it on jack stands. After chocking the wheels, they used bottle jacks on each side of the rear axle to raise the bus high enough to place a 20-ton hydraulic jack under the differential. With the bus resting on a pair of small jack stands, they raised the bus by the differential so that the weight of the bus was balanced on the hydraulic jack.

The mechanics then began to place a large jack stand under the driver's side of the bus. The mechanics were under the bus positioning the jack stand when the mechanic noticed that the hydraulic jack was beginning to tip, and he called out to the apprentice that the bus was coming down. The jack tipped to one side, causing the weight of the bus to drop suddenly onto the small jack stand on the passenger side of the bus. As the apprentice slid from under the bus, the weight of the bus landed on the small jack stand under the passenger side, causing it to break and drop the rear tire to the ground. The apprentice cut his right forearm on a jagged metal edge on the storage compartment as he moved out from under the bus.

The construction manager ordered a root cause analysis, which revealed a number of causal factors. The most obvious of these was the small jack stand breaking and dropping the bus to the ground on one side. Even more significantly, the work package failed to provide adequate information on the type of bus and environment in which the mechanics would be working, and no procedure existed for jacking up vehicles. Investigators were unable to conclusively determine the reason the hydraulic jack tipped.

The work package did not describe the bus that would be involved: a hydrogen prototype bus that is heavier than conventional fuel bus models and has an uneven lateral weight distribution. The bus’ total weight was 30,000 pounds, two-thirds of which was in the rear. The mechanics had never worked with this type of bus before, and were unprepared for the task. They proceeded to perform the task as they had done in the past with conventional buses.

The work package did not specify a safe location for working on this type of bus. The bus was sitting on an asphalt surface, with a slight slope toward the front, and was locked. The mechanics had no way to move it onto a concrete pad, which would have provided greater stability.

The mechanics were relying on skill-of-the-craft to perform this work because there was no procedure on safely jacking heavy vehicles. They did not use cribbing to more evenly distribute the bus’ weight, and the hydraulic jack was not equipped with a saddle or cup to prevent slipping. A procedure on jacking up vehicles would have significantly reduced the likelihood of this accident.

Following the critique, the construction manager began developing a procedure on jacking and cribbing mobile equipment. Training will be provided to mechanical personnel when the procedure is complete. In addition, the construction group will develop a system for identifying work requests involving different mobile equipment.
一辆氢气原型客车从液压千斤顶上滑落,一名机械学徒从车底快速滑出时右前臂撕裂。这名机械学徒和另一名机械师将巴士从地面抬起约 1 英尺,准备将其放置在千斤顶架上时,液压千斤顶翻倒了。这名学徒被送往现场医疗机构,他的前臂伤口需要缝合五针。

机械师们正在升起一辆氢气原型客车（如下图所示）的尾部,并将其放在千斤顶支架上。在锁住车轮后,他们在后车轴两侧各使用一个瓶式千斤顶,将巴士升到足够高的位置,以便在差速器下放置一个 20 吨重的液压千斤顶。将巴士放在一对小型千斤顶支架上,他们用差速器将巴士抬起,使巴士的重量在液压千斤顶上保持平衡。

然后,机械师开始将一个大千斤顶架放在巴士驾驶员一侧的下方。机械师在巴士下面放置千斤顶支架时,注意到液压千斤顶开始倾斜,他向学徒喊道,巴士要倒了。千斤顶向一侧倾斜,导致巴士的重量突然落到了巴士乘客一侧的小千斤顶架上。当学徒从客车下滑落时,客车的重量落在了副驾驶下方的小千斤顶支架上,导致支架断裂,后轮胎掉落在地。学徒从车底滑出时,右前臂被储物箱上的锯齿状金属边缘割伤。

施工经理下令进行根本原因分析,结果发现了一些致因。其中最明显的是小千斤顶支架断裂,导致巴士一侧倒地。更重要的是,工作包中没有提供有关巴士类型和机械师工作环境的足够信息,也没有关于顶起车辆的程序。调查人员无法最终确定液压千斤顶倾倒的原因。

工作包中没有描述所涉及的客车：一辆氢气原型客车,比传统燃料客车重,横向重量分布不均。这辆巴士的总重量为 30,000 磅,其中三分之二在后部。机械师以前从未接触过这种类型的巴士,对这项任务毫无准备。他们按照以往操作传统客车的方法执行任务。

工作包没有规定在这种类型的巴士上工作的安全位置。公交车停在沥青路面上,车头略有倾斜,车门紧锁。机械师们没有办法把车移到水泥垫子上,而水泥垫子可以提供更大的稳定性。

由于没有安全顶起重型车辆的程序,机械师们只能依靠技术来完成这项工作。他们没有使用垫木来更均匀地分散巴士的重量,液压千斤顶也没有配备防止滑落的鞍座或杯状装置。如果制定了车辆顶升程序,就会大大降低事故发生的可能性。

批评结束后,施工经理开始制定移动设备的顶升和吊装程序。程序完成后,将对机械人员进行培训。此外,施工组还将开发一套系统,用于识别涉及不同移动设备的工作请求。","None

The cylinder suffered a failure at an indicated pressure of 1500 psia during filling. Investigation of the failure subsequently revealed that a faulty digital readout had allowed the cylinder to be over-pressurized. There were no safety consequences due to the failure and no damage to the facility or equipment. The cylinder was being filled in a test vault that was specially designed for the high-pressure burst testing of pressure vessels and components. While no over-pressure cylinders were released from the laboratory for use, this incident is being reported to address the potential and subsequent lessons learned.

Investigations revealed that the pressure transducer was faulty and the actual pressure could have been more than five times the indicated pressure. Although the high-pressure manifold has rupture-disk protection, the rupture disk was not adequately sized to provide protection for this type of cylinder. Thus, the failed digital pressure instrument was the single barrier to over pressurizing a cylinder.

调查显示,压力传感器存在故障,实际压力可能是指示压力的五倍以上。虽然高压歧管有爆破片保护,但爆破片的尺寸不足以为这种类型的气缸提供保护。因此,失灵的数字压力仪表是气瓶超压的唯一障碍。","None

A shunt inside experimental equipment overheated and caused insulation on conductors to burn. Flames were approximately one inch high and very localized. The employee de-energized equipment and blew out the flames. No combustible material was in the vicinity of the experiment. The fire was contained within the fuel cell and resulted in no damage to equipment.

The employee was conducting work with a fuel cell supplied by oxygen gas. The hazard control plan (HCP) associated with the work was for use with fuel cells supplied by air or hydrogen, but not for oxygen, which yields a higher current density. The technician had set up the station wiring to handle a current of 100 amps and the shunt was configured to handle a current of 100 amps, but the station load box could handle up to 180 amps, and during the experimental run the increased current density applied 150 amps power to the wiring.

Electrical wires overheated and melted, causing a short and fire in the fuel cell.
一名员工发现燃料电池实验室内有异常气味。实验设备内的分流器过热,导致导体绝缘层燃烧。火焰大约有一英寸高,而且非常局部。该员工切断了设备电源并吹灭了火焰。实验附近没有可燃物。火势被控制在燃料电池内,未造成设备损坏。

该员工当时正在使用由氧气供应的燃料电池进行工作。与该工作相关的危险控制计划 (HCP) 适用于由空气或氢气供应的燃料电池,但不适用于产生较高电流密度的氧气。技术人员将电站线路设置为处理 100 安培的电流,并将分流器配置为处理 100 安培的电流,但电站负载箱可处理高达 180 安培的电流,在实验运行期间,增加的电流密度向线路施加了 150 安培的功率。

During review of an Emergency Management Hazard Assessment document, a reviewer questioned whether the SAB of nearby facilities had been reviewed for the effect of the installed 9000-gallon liquid hydrogen tank. Reviews by the facility management and facility safety personnel confirmed the evaluations have not been performed.

The direct cause was determined to be a management problem, with policy not adequately defined, disseminated, or enforced to integrate potential lessee hazards into the facility safety program documentation on the 9000-gallon hydrogen tank and delivery. The existing policy intended that potential unidentified safety question related to lessee activities be proactively pursued by facility managers through existing procedures. However, the facility managers did not recognize the need to integrate potential lessee hazards into the facility safety program for any potential impacts to surrounding facilities. It was concluded that additional procedural guidance for facility management regarding these reindustrialization issues was required.

The root cause was determined to be a procedure problem. The infrastructure facility management, safety documentation procedures in place at the time of this occurrence did not address reindustrialization interfaces or the potential impact of reindustrialization on facility safety authorization basis documentation. This contributed to a presumed lack of authority and responsibility by facility management where reindustrialization activities were involved. The root cause of the occurrence indicates a need to revise the implementing procedures to clearly describe interfaces with the reindustrialization program.

直接原因被确定为管理问题,政策没有充分定义,传播或执行,以将潜在的承租人危险纳入有关 9000 加仑氢气罐和交付的设施安全计划文件中。现行政策旨在让设施管理人员通过现有程序,积极主动地处理与承租人活动有关的潜在未发现安全问题。然而,设施管理人员并未认识到有必要将潜在的承租人危险纳入设施安全计划,以避免对周围设施造成任何潜在影响。结论是,需要就这些再工业化问题为设施管理人员提供额外的程序指导。

根本原因被确定为程序问题。事件发生时的基础设施管理和安全文件编制程序并未涉及再工业化界面或再工业化对设施安全授权基础文件的潜在影响。这就造成了在涉及再工业化活动时,设备管理部门缺乏权力和责任。事件发生的根本原因表明,有必要修订实施程序,以明确说明与再工业化计划的接口。","None

所有安全装置均按设计运行,从而保护了环境和实验室人员。参与实验的研究人员按照操作程序规定的参数正确行事。后续行动： 已在仪器上加装了止动器,以防止阀门打开过大而损坏 0 形环密封件。","A hydrogen gas detector on the ground floor of a building registered the release of a small amount of hydrogen gas and actuated automatic alarms both at the fire department and in one of its buildings. Additionally, interlocks connected to the gas detector completely shut down the experiment. Upon hearing the alarm, all occupants (about 6) promptly left the building. Fire department personnel are housed in the trailer next to a building and responded within one minute. They tested the atmosphere within the building, reset the gas detector, and secured the alarm at 9:15. The alarm was actuated when an experimenter assigned to the experiment was evacuating lines using a vacuum pump.

The speed of evacuation was controlled by a commercially manufactured flow meter. It is believed that the 0-ring in the manually operated valve had deteriorated and that a small amount of hydrogen gas escaped while the valve was being turned. The flow was set at approximately 1 l/min at a pressure of only 6 psi. The gas detector is located within 30cm of the valve so the time from release to solenoid activation should be less than one second. Using these criteria, it is estimated that the total release of hydrogen gas is less than l cc.

Sufficient testing and investigation has confirmed that a minimal amount of hydrogen escaped around a failed O-ring located in the valve of the commercially manufactured flow meter (direct and root cause). A significant contributing cause is the lack of a stop to prevent the valve from being opened to the point of the O-ring being damaged or distorted by contact with the threads of the valve. The flow meter in question is used only in the gas evacuation process so is opened to it's fullest extent at least daily. Although we have confirmed that no caution against over turning exists in the manuals accompanying the flow meters, we believe that this may have led to premature failure of the O-ring.
一栋大楼底层的氢气探测器记录了少量氢气的释放,并触发了消防部门及其一栋大楼的自动警报。此外,与气体探测器相连的联锁装置完全关闭了实验。听到警报后,所有住户（约 6 人）迅速离开了大楼。消防队人员被安置在大楼旁边的拖车内,并在一分钟内做出反应。他们检测了楼内的空气,重置了气体探测器,并在 9:15 拉响了警报。警报是在一名被指派参与实验的实验员使用真空泵抽空管路时触发的。

抽真空的速度由商用流量计控制。据信,手动操作阀门的 0 形环已经损坏,阀门转动时有少量氢气逸出。流量设定为大约 1 升/分钟,压力仅为 6 磅/平方英寸。气体探测器位于阀门 30 厘米范围内,因此从释放到电磁阀启动的时间应小于一秒。根据这些标准,估计氢气的总释放量小于 1 毫升。充分的测试和调查证实,在商业制造的流量计阀门中一个失效的 O 形环周围有极少量的氢气泄漏（直接原因和根本原因）。一个重要原因是阀门没有止动装置,以防止阀门被打开到 O 形环因与阀门螺纹接触而损坏或变形的程度。该流量计仅在气体排空过程中使用,因此至少每天都会打开到最大程度。虽然我们已确认流量计的随附手册中没有关于过度转动的警告,但我们认为这可能导致 O 形环过早失效。","None

The large valve is equipped with a small bypass valve so that the valve can be pressurized on both sides as is required before the valve can be reset. The O-ring which makes this small valve gas tight was deformed and improperly seated, thus allowing gas to flow to each side of the large valve. This permitted the valve to trip normally, but not to seat properly. The following is the manufacturer's evaluation after disassembly and inspection of the valve.

This valve was recently installed to provide excess flow protection to the underground portion of the hydrogen system piping and to provide redundant protection to the entire system. To have this valve out of service means that the protection remains the same as it has for many years, with the distribution system from the building's hydrogen control point onward being protected by an excess flow valve. This building's valve has always tested properly on the annual test and tested properly on a recent test.

Follow up: The valve has been returned to the manufacturer, rebuilt, tested and re-installed in our system. Testing on re- installation indicates that the valve is working properly.

Monitoring the pressure drop across the HEPA filter is not a sufficient or reliable indicator of ventilation system performance (air flow). An air flow monitor incorporating a low-level alarm would have provided a reliable indication of ventilation system performance.
在焚烧箱的设计和安装过程中,应更多地考虑到排气扇的静压限制与高效过滤器的预期静压积聚之间的关系。监测高效过滤器的压降并不能充分或可靠地反映通风系统的性能（空气流量）。空气流量监测仪如能配备一个低水平警报器,就能可靠地显示通风系统的性能。","While attempting to light the hydrogen flare inside a Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) system burn box, a small explosion occurred, blowing the back section of the burn box off. Hydrogen flow was shut down immediately, and this MOCVD operation was suspended. Researchers made the determination that this was a minor incident and there were no injuries.

The follow-up investigation determined that the MOCVD HEPA filter had become sufficiently loaded to the point where performance of the burn box exhaust ventilation system was significantly degraded. The static pressure created across the ""loaded"" HEPA filter equaled the operating static pressure of the exhaust ventilation system servicing the burn box. This resulted in a region of ""dead air"" in the burn box. Thus, without sufficient dilution, the volume of hydrogen that accumulated in the burn box exceeded the 4% lower explosion limit (LEL) for hydrogen. When the operator attempted to light the hydrogen flare, the accumulated hydrogen/air mixture ignited. This is identified as the ""direct"" cause of the incident. The researchers monitor the pressure drop across the filter as an indicator of when to replace the filter. At the time of initial installation, static pressure across the filter was measured -1.0"" w.g. The pressure drop indicated at the time of the occurrence (-2.5"" w.g.) was within the normal/nominal operating parameters established by researchers for this apparatus.

However, in retrospect, pressure drop alone is not a sufficient or reliable indicator of air flow (exhaust ventilation system performance). This is cited as a contributing cause.

The root cause of the occurrence is identified as a design error. Exhaust fan performance available to the apparatus was not sufficient to overcome the maximum level of filter loading created by this experiment. This requirement was not sufficiently evaluated during the conception, design and installation of this experiment.

 
在试图点燃金属有机化学气相沉积（MOCVD）系统燃烧箱内的氢气照明弹时,发生了小规模爆炸,将燃烧箱后部炸飞。氢气流立即被关闭,MOCVD 操作也被暂停。研究人员认定这是一起小事故,没有人员伤亡。

后续调查确定,MOCVD HEPA 过滤器的负荷已高达燃烧箱排气通风系统性能严重下降的程度。在 ""加载 ""的高效过滤器上产生的静压等于为燃烧室提供服务的排气通风系统的工作静压。这导致焚烧箱内出现 ""死气 ""区域。因此,在没有充分稀释的情况下,燃烧箱内积聚的氢气体积超过了 4% 的氢气爆炸下限 (LEL)。当操作员试图点燃氢气照明弹时,积聚的氢气/空气混合物被点燃。这被认定为事故的 ""直接 ""原因。研究人员监测过滤器上的压降,以此作为何时更换过滤器的指标。在最初安装时,过滤器上的静压测量值为 -1.0 ""w.g.,而事故发生时显示的压降（-2.5 ""w.g.）为 -1.0 ""w.g.。) 在研究人员为该仪器设定的正常/额定运行参数范围内。

然而,回过头来看,压降本身并不能充分或可靠地反映空气流量（排气通风系统性能）。这也是造成事故的原因之一。

事件发生的根本原因被认定为设计错误。设备的排气扇性能不足以克服本实验所产生的最大过滤器负荷。在实验的构思,设计和安装过程中,没有对这一要求进行充分评估。

Additional control measures were required to reduce the risk of fire and to ensure that consequences of an incipient fire were minimized.
由于使用氢气和/或存在少量水合肼,化学实验室罩内发生严重火灾的风险被低估了。需要采取额外的控制措施来降低火灾风险,并确保将初期火灾的后果降至最低。","While filling a sample cylinder with compressed hydrogen gas, a quick-disconnect coupler fitting came loose within a stainless steel laboratory hood, allowing a small purge of the hydrogen gas to escape directly into the hood through ~1/4-inch Tygon tubing. The stainless steel quick-disconnect fitting struck the stainless steel bottom of the laboratory hood and the hydrogen gas caught fire. It is not known what caused the hydrogen gas to catch fire. The most likely sources of a spark was from metal-to-metal contact of the quick-disconnect fitting with the laboratory hood floor, or the discharge of static electrical charge generated by flow of hydrogen gas through Tygon tubing. The resultant narrow jet of fire, directed toward the left side of the laboratory hood, extinguished itself within a few seconds of when the operator closed an upstream valve that was supplying the compressed hydrogen gas to the sample cylinder.

The operator was not injured and the only apparent damage was from minor melting of a short length of Tygon tubing. In addition to several 8-inch to 24-inch lengths of Tygon tubing and a plastic beaker, there was a 500 milliliter (ml) glass bottle containing approximately 300 ml of hydrazine-hydrate stored in the laboratory hood. This flammable chemical is periodically used as an additive for maintaining water chemistry. No additional fire extinguishing action was necessary inside the hood, but as a precautionary measure, the operator used a low-pressure demineralized water (LDW) tap within the hood to rinse/cool surfaces within the hood. Since there was no apparent remaining fire extinguishing action required, fire department assistance was not requested.

The operator immediately performed a walk down of the laboratory hood exhaust ventilation system to ensure no fire had occurred in the HVAC duct work, downstream of the laboratory hood. Some smoke was evident downstream of the laboratory HEPA filter, on the third floor mezzanine room where the laboratory hood exhaust fan is located; otherwise, all systems visible to the operator were found to be normal. Follow-up radiological surveys showed there was no spread of radiological contamination due to the operator having exited the room without surveying himself.

The direct and root causes for this event were a design problem. The quick-disconnect fitting on the chemical addition system became unintentionally disconnected. The release of hydrogen gas into the hood enclosure, combined with a spark generated from either the metal fitting striking the metal floor of the hood enclosure or discharge of static electricity from flow of the gas through non-metallic Tygon tubing created a fire hazard. To eliminate the hazard completely, two sets of quick-disconnect fittings (of the type that became unintentionally disconnected) and use of Tygon tubing were eliminated and replaced with a hard-piped system. The small quantity of hydrogen gas being purged through the sample cylinder was also redirected such that it was released near the top of the hood and immediately adjacent to the hood exhaust duct work. A locking device was then provided for the remaining two sample cylinder quick-disconnect fittings to prevent them from separating without first removing the locking device.
在给一个样品钢瓶充入压缩氢气时,不锈钢实验罩内的一个快速断开连接接头松动,导致少量氢气通过 ~1/4 英寸 Tygon 管直接进入实验罩。不锈钢快速接头撞击到实验室通风橱的不锈钢底部,氢气起火。氢气起火的原因尚不清楚。最有可能的火花来源是快速接头与实验室通风橱地板的金属对金属接触,或氢气流经 Tygon 管时产生的静电放电。在操作员关闭向样品气瓶供应压缩氢气的上游阀门后几秒钟内,向实验室通风橱左侧喷射的狭长火舌自行熄灭。

操作员没有受伤,唯一明显的损坏是一小段泰贡管子轻微熔化。除了几根 8 英寸到 24 英寸长的泰贡管子和一个塑料烧杯外,实验室罩内还存放着一个 500 毫升的玻璃瓶,瓶内装有大约 300 毫升的水合肼。这种易燃化学品被定期用作维持水化学的添加剂。机罩内无需采取额外的灭火措施,但作为预防措施,操作员在机罩内使用了一个低压去矿物质水（LDW）水龙头来冲洗/冷却机罩内的表面。由于没有明显的其他灭火措施,因此没有请求消防部门的援助。

操作员立即对实验室通风柜的排气通风系统进行了检查,以确保实验室通风柜下游的暖通空调管道工程没有发生火灾。在实验室 HEPA 过滤器的下游,也就是实验室抽油烟机排气扇所在的三楼夹层房间内,可以看到一些烟雾；除此之外,操作员可以看到的所有系统均正常。后续的辐射调查显示,由于操作员在离开房间时没有进行自我调查,因此辐射污染没有扩散。

这次事件的直接和根本原因是设计问题。化学品添加系统上的快速接头无意中断开。氢气释放到气罩外壳中,再加上金属接头撞击气罩外壳金属地板产生的火花,或气体流经非金属泰贡管时产生的静电放电,造成了火灾隐患。为了彻底消除危险,取消了两套快速断开接头（无意中断开的那种）和使用 Tygon 管,代之以硬管系统。通过样品钢瓶净化的少量氢气也被重新定向,使其在靠近通风橱顶部和紧邻通风橱排气管道的地方释放。然后为剩余的两个样品气瓶快速断开接头安装了一个锁定装置,以防止它们在未卸下锁定装置的情况下分离。","spark from quick-disconnect fitting striking floor of laboratory hood

Important to note that the safety system functioned as intended. Most prevalent learning is that liquid air will form and fall off the vent stack due to very high flow of very cold gas when the relief systems are flowing at capacity. Liquid air may also splash off flanges or other pieces and will cause a small vapor cloud as it falls from the stack. Falling liquid air was mistaken for liquid hydrogen during the event.
一个冗余安全电路投入使用,故障发生后,油罐恢复了正常运行。更换了两个爆破片,并对油罐进行了检查。重要的是,安全系统按预期运行。最普遍的教训是,当泄压系统的流量达到最大时,由于极冷气体的流量非常大,会形成液态空气并从通风口掉落。液态空气还可能从法兰或其他部件上飞溅下来,并在从烟囱掉落时产生少量蒸汽云。在这次事件中,掉落的液态空气被误认为是液态氢。","A liquid hydrogen tank’s rupture disc failed prematurely, which caused the tank to vent its entire gas contents through the tank’s vent stack. Venting was very loud and formed a condensed moisture cloud visible from the top of the stack. Liquid air was also visible coming off the stack. Venting ceased after approximately 5 minutes. On-site staff called the fire department, which arrived promptly and evacuated the area. Normal operations resumed after the Fire Department was able to determine there were no unsafe conditions.
一个液氢储罐的爆破片过早失效,导致储罐内的气体全部通过储罐的排气烟囱排出。排气声非常大,并形成了从烟囱顶部可见的冷凝湿云。此外,还可以看到液态空气从烟囱排出。大约 5 分钟后,排气停止。现场工作人员呼叫了消防队,消防队迅速赶到并疏散了现场人员。在消防部门确定不存在不安全状况后,正常运行得以恢复。","None

今后,这种介孔碳材料和氨硼烷：介孔碳材料将在厌氧条件下（手套箱）进行处理,以防止再发生事故。","During preparation of a new hydrogen storage material, ammonia borane (AB) loaded onto mesoporous carbon, an unexpected incident was observed. As with all procedures with new materials the work is conducted on a small scale and in a laboratory fume hood. They followed the procedures that they had used for absorption of ammonia borane onto mesoporous silica without incident.

To absorb the solid AB into a scaffold material they dissolve AB in a dry aprotic polar solvent, THF. The saturated solution of AB in THF is added to the mesoporous carbon material in a round bottom flask, stirred for 10 minutes to saturate the mesoporous scaffold with AB and then the solvent is slowly removed under vacuum. At this point the sample is assumed to be prepared and ready for transfer to a sample vial for storage.

The material (1:1 mesoporous carbon:AB) was exposed to the atmosphere for close to five minutes without incident and the round bottom flask containing the material was cool to the touch as they have always noted for the silica materials. In order to transfer the material from the round bottom flask to the storage vessel a stainless steel spatula was introduced to the round bottom flask. Upon touching the stainless steel spatula against the inside of the flask, the flask became warm to touch and then a small flame was observed to arise from the round bottom flask. The flask was immediately placed under a large glass crystallizing dish to remove oxygen and the flame was extinguished. After the flame was extinguished, the flask was then placed under nitrogen atmosphere.

Dry carbon materials have been reported to develop a static charge under vacuum. It is likely that using the metal spatula provided a grounding source to release the charge. This static charge may have been responsible for the flame and any exothermic reaction. Likely residual THF ignited.
在制备一种新型储氢材料--负载在介孔碳上的氨硼烷（AB）的过程中,发现了一个意想不到的现象。与所有使用新材料的程序一样,这项工作是在实验室通风橱中小规模进行的。他们沿用了在介孔二氧化硅上吸收硼烷氨的程序,没有发生意外。

为了将固体 AB 吸收到支架材料中,他们将 AB 溶解在干燥的非沸腾极性溶剂 THF 中。将 AB 在 THF 中的饱和溶液加入到圆底烧瓶中的介孔碳材料中,搅拌 10 分钟,使介孔支架中的 AB 达到饱和,然后在真空下缓慢去除溶剂。此时,可认为样品已经制备完成,可以转移到样品瓶中储存。

材料（1:1 介孔碳：AB）在大气中暴露了近五分钟,没有发生任何意外,装有材料的圆底烧瓶触感凉爽,这也是二氧化硅材料的一贯特点。为了将材料从圆底烧瓶转移到储存容器中,将不锈钢刮刀插入圆底烧瓶。当不锈钢刮刀接触烧瓶内壁时,烧瓶变得温热,然后观察到圆底烧瓶中冒出一簇小火苗。立即将烧瓶放在一个大的玻璃结晶皿下以去除氧气,然后熄灭火焰。火焰熄灭后,将烧瓶置于氮气环境中。

据报道,干燥的碳材料在真空下会产生静电。使用金属刮刀很可能是释放静电的接地源。这种静电荷可能是火焰和任何放热反应的原因。可能点燃了残留的四氢呋喃。","None

Laboratory procedures should be in written form and should be adopted only after performing a safety vulnerability analysis and adopting appropriate risk mitigation steps.	Working with small amounts of material does not provide assurance of safety.	The method described to seal samples that are highly reactive upon exposure to air is not recommended. An alternative method, that is now being used for packaging aluminum hydride samples for offsite shipment is as follows: Aluminum hydride powders (0.5 g - 1.0 g) are sealed in glass bottles with a cap. The bottles are sealed in a thick plastic bag under Ar using a plastic bag sealer in the glove box. The sample bags are then removed from the glove box and sealed under vacuum in a much larger plastic bag using a vacuum sealer. The purpose of the large evacuated bag is to contain any evolved hydrogen gas if the material begins to decompose and the internal bottle &amp; bag rupture. It is a good idea to calculate the maximum volume of H2 (at 1-atm) that could be released by the sample to determine if the outer bag is sufficiently large to contain the evolved gas. The package is then inserted into a cardboard box of sufficient volume (about 1-liter) to accommodate the expanded outer bag.Additional discussion about working with reactive metal-hydride materials in the laboratory can be found in the Lessons Learned Corner on this website and in the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices Manual.
在处理成分特征不明确的金属氢化物材料时,程序应假定该类材料,中间体或前体的 ""最坏情况""。实验室程序应采用书面形式,并应在进行安全漏洞分析和采取适当的风险缓解措施后方可采用。使用少量材料并不能保证安全。不建议采用所述方法来密封暴露在空气中会发生高度反应的样品。目前用于包装氢化铝样品以进行异地运输的替代方法如下： 将氢化铝粉末（0. 5 克 - 1. 0 克）密封在带盖的玻璃瓶中。使用手套箱中的塑料袋封口机,在 Ar 下将瓶子密封在厚塑料袋中。然后将样品袋从手套箱中取出,用真空封口机在真空状态下密封在一个更大的塑料袋中。大号抽真空袋的作用是在材料开始分解和内部瓶&amp;袋破裂的情况下容纳任何挥发的氢气。最好计算一下样品可能释放的最大氢气量（1-atm 时）,以确定外袋是否足够大,可以容纳挥发出来的气体。然后将包装放入一个容积足够大（约 1 升）的纸箱中,以容纳膨胀的外袋。有关在实验室中使用反应性金属氢化物材料的更多讨论,请参阅本网站的 ""经验总结 ""和《氢气安全最佳实践手册》。","A researcher was working with hydrogen storage materials in a laboratory. Several other researchers were working in adjacent laboratories.

The researcher had prepared a sample of aluminum deuteride, AlD3, by reacting lithium aluminum deuteride and aluminum chloride in diethyl ether. The actual composition/phase of the material synthesized was unknown, but the researcher had attempted to produce the gamma phase of aluminum deuteride. The synthesis steps used to produce the material were complete and the researcher attempted to seal the material in a glass ampoule for offsite shipment and analysis. The sample size was approximately 1 gram.

The ampoule with the sample had previously been placed under vacuum and had been isolated from the atmosphere. The process for sealing the ampoule was to first place the sample-containing ampoule in a liquid nitrogen bath to cool the sample down to near 77K. The ampoule was then removed from the liquid nitrogen and a torch was used to melt the neck of the ampoule to seal it. The ampoule was slowly rotated while heat was applied to the neck of the ampoule. Typically, this results in collapse of the ampoule, sealing the sample. However, in this instance, a bubble formed where the heat was applied and a hole formed in the ampoule. This allowed air to enter the previously evacuated container.

After about 30 seconds the ampoule “exploded” and glass from the container was sprayed outward. Some of the shards embedded into the researcher’s arms, face and torso (the researcher was wearing safety glasses, but no other safety equipment). Other researchers working in an adjacent laboratory heard the noise and came to see what had happened. The researcher was taken to the hospital and treated. Larger shards of glass were removed and the injured area was cleaned in an effort to remove the smaller pieces of glass. The researcher stayed home the next day, but returned the second day after the incident. There appears to be no permanent damage to the researcher and he/she is continuing work in the laboratory.

该研究人员通过氘化铝锂和氯化铝在二乙醚中的反应制备了氘化铝样品 AlD3。合成材料的实际成分/物相不详,但研究人员试图制备氘化铝的伽马相。用于生产该材料的合成步骤已经完成,研究人员试图将该材料密封在玻璃安瓿瓶中, 以便异地运输和分析。样品量约为 1 克。

装有样品的安瓿之前一直处于真空状态,与大气隔绝。密封安瓿的过程是先将装有样品的安瓿放入液氮浴中,将样品冷却到接近 77K 的温度。然后将安瓿从液氮中取出,用喷灯熔化安瓿的颈部,将其密封。在对安瓿颈部加热的同时缓慢旋转安瓿。通常情况下,这会导致安瓿塌陷,从而密封样品。然而,在这种情况下,受热处形成了一个气泡,安瓿上形成了一个洞。这样,空气就进入了先前抽空的容器。大约 30 秒后,安瓿 ""爆炸"",容器中的玻璃向外喷射。一些碎片嵌入研究人员的手臂,脸部和躯干（研究人员当时戴着安全眼镜,但没有其他安全设备）。在邻近实验室工作的其他研究人员听到响声后赶来查看发生了什么事。研究人员被送往医院接受治疗。清除了较大的玻璃碎片,并对受伤部位进行了清洗,以清除较小的玻璃碎片。研究员第二天留在家中,但在事件发生后的第二天返回了医院。该研究员似乎没有受到永久性伤害,目前正在实验室继续工作。","None

The sample consisted of mechanically milled NaAlH4 with 4% TiCl3 dopant which was prepared in an argon atmosphere. The sample was sealed and placed in the probe head of an NMR magic angle-spinning (MAS) rotor and spun at approximately 9,000-13,000 rpm. During the process, the sealing cap dislodged and exposed the sample to ambient air for a little less than 24 hours. When discovered, the sample was visually inspected and showed no evidence of oxidation. The sample was re-capped and returned to an argon environment for removal. Most of the sample material was removed using a small stainless steel needle, but a residual amount, roughly 25 mg sodium alanate, proceeded to undergo a rapid exothermic reaction. No damage resulted to the tube, the glove box or the scientist.

The lab does not know the composition of the material after exposure to the ambient air nor the ignition energy needed to initiate the reaction. However, it appeared that this material underwent a rapid exothermic reaction requiring very little ignition energy.

Aside from exposing this safety hazard, and the relatively minor incident, laboratory personnel pointed out the advantage of working with small samples.

The lab is planning to study this phenomenon, including the running of a time-of-flight mass spectrographic study, to determine what occurred. It will be important for the community at large to be aware of any potentially unknown hazards of working with these materials. The lab believes that the slow exposure to room air is the greatest concern. While loose powder samples will quickly react with the air and ignite, this tightly packed powder indicated no signs of reactivity.

实验室不知道暴露在环境空气中后材料的成分,也不知道引发反应所需的点火能量。不过,这种材料似乎发生了快速放热反应,所需的点火能量很小。

除了揭露这一安全隐患和相对较小的事件外,实验室人员还指出了使用小样本的好处。实验室正计划研究这一现象,包括进行飞行时间质谱研究,以确定发生了什么。对于整个社会来说,了解使用这些材料可能带来的未知危害是非常重要的。实验室认为,在室内空气中缓慢暴露是最令人担忧的问题。松散的粉末样品会很快与空气发生反应并被点燃,而这种紧密包装的粉末却没有任何反应迹象。","None

Emergency responders were on scene within 7 minutes and contained the fire within 3hours. No damage was reported to the separate forecourt H2 dispenser or to other major station components within the station backcourt compound. No personnel injuries resulted directly from the fire and explosion -a nearby vehicle airbag triggered due to the explosion pressure, with minor injuries to the vehicle occupants. Immediately, until root cause was determined, all potentially affected H2 stations were idled.

The root cause of the incident was subsequently identified as an assembly error of a specific plug in a hydrogen tank in the high-pressure storage unit. The inner bolts of the plug had not been adequately torqued. This led to a hydrogen leak, creating a mixture of hydrogen and air that ignited. The source of ignition has not been positively identified. An inspection and integrity verification program for the high-pressure storage units with similar plugs was implemented, including check and re-torque of tank plugs. Additional measures implemented include revised assembly, verification, and documentation procedures as well as increased automated leak detection frequency.

Verify H2 compatibility of components and their specifications as early in the design or procurement process as possible.Manufacturer-provided literature (brochures, instruction manuals, bills of materials, etc.) may not always identify the specific materials for each component, so verification may require Internet research or contacting the manufacturer to obtain the necessary information or certification. 
作为氢气系统设备采购流程的一部分,维持一个内部流程,以验证组件润湿材料与预期用途的兼容性。 不要仅仅依靠制造商提供适当等级的材料和部件。在设计或采购过程中尽早验证部件的 H2 兼容性及其规格。制造商提供的资料（宣传册,使用手册,材料清单等）可能并不总能确定每个组件的具体材料,因此可能需要通过互联网研究或联系制造商来获得必要的信息或认证。 .","The sensing diaphragm of a pressure transducer (PT), as supplied on an outdoor hydrogen compressor, unexpectedly ruptured and released approximately 0.1 kilograms hydrogen to atmosphere from the compressor discharge line. At time of incident, personnel nearby were alerted by a loud 'pop' and dust disturbance. Simultaneously, the facility monitoring system detected loss of the PT signal and initiated equipment shutdown. Facility personnel then closed isolation hand valves to stop the leak, locked and tagged out the equipment, and restricted the area. The failed component, a cigar type PT rated to 20,000 psi, originally supplied and installed by the manufacturer as part of the compressor package, was removed and inspected. Inspection revealed severed wires, a separated wire housing, missing electronics and damaged electrical potting.  The PT was on a line protected by a pressure safety valve set to 15,400 psi. 

Facility investigators later discovered that the failed discharge PT was manufactured with a 17-4PH stainless steel diaphragm. This type of stainless steel, while an industry standard for high pressure resistance with other materials, is known in industry to be incompatible with hydrogen. The compressor manufacturer's supplied documentation generally claimed use of materials resistant to effects of H2 embrittlement at expected operating conditions, but did not identify the specific materials of internal components such as PT diaphragms. The facility operator's commissioning procedures included functional test of each PT but did not include review of individual compressor component specifications.  Subsequent communications between facility investigators and compressor representatives revealed that the compressor manufacturer did not intend to supply 17-4PH material in its compressor components; the diaphragm material was overlooked by the compressor manufacturer when sourcing the PT. The compressor was subsequently repaired with a replacement PT using Nitronic 50 material, and a compatible pressure switch hardwired to the facility 'STOP' signal was added.
室外氢气压缩机上的压力传感器 (PT) 的传感隔膜意外破裂,从压缩机排气管中向大气释放了约 0.1 千克氢气。 事故发生时,""啪 ""的一声巨响和粉尘扰动引起了附近人员的警觉。与此同时,设备监控系统检测到 PT 信号丢失,并启动了设备停机。设施人员随后关闭了隔离手阀以阻止泄漏,锁定并标记了设备,并限制了该区域。 故障部件是一个雪茄型 PT,额定压力为 20,000 psi,最初由制造商提供和安装,是压缩机套件的一部分。检查发现电线断裂,电线外壳分离,电子元件丢失和电气灌封损坏。  PT 位于受压力安全阀保护的管线上,压力安全阀设定为 15,400 psi。 .

设备调查人员后来发现,失效的放电 PT 是用 17-4PH 不锈钢隔膜制造的。 这种不锈钢虽然是其他材料耐高压的工业标准,但在工业上却与氢气不相容。 压缩机制造商提供的文件一般声称使用了在预期运行条件下可抵抗 H2 脆化影响的材料,但没有说明 PT 隔膜等内部组件的具体材料。设备运营商的试运行程序包括对每个 PT 进行功能测试,但不包括对各个压缩机部件规格的审查。  设备调查员与压缩机代表之间的后续沟通显示,压缩机制造商并未打算在其压缩机部件中提供 17-4PH 材料；压缩机制造商在采购 PT 时忽略了隔膜材料。随后用使用 Nitronic 50 材料的替换 PT 对压缩机进行了维修,并增加了一个与设备 ""停止 ""信号硬连接的兼容压力开关。","None

运行期间","The procedure for disposal of spent or partially spent AB has been modified so that it does not include the use of water. Instead, the AB is removed from containers and transferred for disposal by rinsing with mineral oil, silicone oil or other similar inert materials. It is then disposed of as a slurry.
废 AB 或部分废 AB 的处置程序已作修改,不包括用水。取而代之的是,用矿物油,硅油或其他类似的惰性材料冲洗 AB,将其从容器中移出并转运处置。然后将其作为泥浆进行处置。","As part of preparing for material disposal, a small fire occurred within a fume hood as a researcher was combining several spent ammonia borane (AB) samples that had previously been stored uncovered in the back of the hood for 6+ months. These AB samples consisted primarily of two 40-gram products of a 50wt% AB in silicone oil that had been thermally dehydrogenated. A small amount of unreacted AB slurry is believed to also have been present.

During project clean-up, partially spent (thermally reacted) ammonia borane (AB) residue from a previous experiment was mixed with a small amount of water to rinse the residue from its container. The water reacted with the spent AB resulting initially in a large heat release followed immediately by a fire. It appears that the water addition to spent AB resulted in hydrolysis of the boron and hydrogen production. This is an exothermic reaction. The high temperature then caused the small amount of unreacted AB to produce pyrophoric gases such as diborane that ignited in the presence of air. The lead scientist pulled the fire alarm, effectively evacuating the building, retrieved a fire extinguisher, and immediately put out the fire. The fire department arrived and confirmed the fire was out, releasing the building for re-entry.

From previous experimental results, it had been concluded that spent AB does not produce diborane with either heat or water addition. However, spontaneous combustion may occur under those conditions with partially spent material. Subsequent causal analysis concluded that the event occurred when water was added to solidified AB material that had been broken up during removal from a flask.

While ammonia borane does not react with water, partially and fully thermally reacted AB does react to produce hydrogen. Use of a small amount of water (50 mL) with a large quantity of hydrogen storage material (&gt;100 g) can result in very high reaction temperatures. With some unreacted AB, the high temperatures can release pyrophoric by-products that would then initiate a flame.
在准备材料处置的过程中,一位研究人员在将几个用过的氨硼烷 (AB) 样品合并时,通风橱内发生了小火,这些样品之前在通风橱后面无遮挡地存放了 6 个多月。这些 AB 样品主要由两个 40 克的产品组成,其中 50wt% 的 AB 在硅油中经过热脱氢处理。据信还有少量未反应的 AB 泥浆。

在项目清理过程中,先前实验中的部分废（热反应）氨硼烷（AB）残留物与少量水混合,以冲洗容器中的残留物。水与氨硼烷残留物发生反应,首先释放出大量热量,随后立即起火。在废 AB 中加水似乎导致了硼的水解和氢的产生。这是一种放热反应。高温导致少量未反应的 AB 产生发火气体,如二硼烷,这些气体在空气中被点燃。首席科学家拉响了火警警报,有效地疏散了大楼内的人员,取来灭火器并立即灭火。消防部门赶到现场,确认火势已被扑灭,这栋大楼才得以重新开放。根据之前的实验结果,废 AB 在加热或加水的情况下都不会产生二硼烷。不过,在这些条件下,部分废料可能会发生自燃。随后的因果分析得出的结论是,当水加入到从烧瓶中移出时破裂的固化 AB 材料中时,就会发生自燃。

虽然硼烷氨不会与水发生反应,但部分和完全热反应的 AB 会发生反应产生氢气。使用少量的水（50 毫升）和大量的储氢材料（100 克）会导致非常高的反应温度。对于某些未反应的 AB,高温会释放出发火的副产品,进而引发火焰。","(Spontaneous combustion)

运行期间","The researcher's failure to pull the fire alarm was an oversight of required facility practice. The alarm should have been triggered in consideration of the potential for greater harm to personnel and facilities.Hot, reacting ammonia borane produces hydrogen as well as other pyrophoric impurities. Reactions should be carried out in inert atmospheres or purged with inert gases. Furthermore, efforts should be made to prevent oxygen from coming in contact with the material while hot.As a consequence of this incident, an updated procedure was put in place to check critical fittings before each subsequent test and to purge the apparatus with argon in the area surrounding the reactor/fittings.
研究人员没有拉响火警警报是对设施规定做法的疏忽。本应在考虑到可能对人员和设施造成更大伤害的情况下触发警报。热的硼烷氨反应会产生氢气和其他发火杂质。反应应在惰性气氛中进行或用惰性气体吹扫。此外,还应努力防止氧气在高温时与材料接触。由于发生了这起事件,已制定了最新的程序,在以后每次试验前都要检查关键的配件,并在反应器/配件周围用氩气吹扫设备。","While performing hydrogen gas release experimentation by thermally reacting a slurry of ammonia borane powder in silicone oil in a plug flow reactor, a discharge port on the test reactor became loose. A foaming white product was leaking from the fitting and discharging in the direction of the heat tape and insulation (back over the reactor). As a result, hot, reacting slurry flowed out of the port and was exposed to air. In the presence of oxygen, the slurry ignited, producing a green flame. A small green flame was noticed at the leak site and flaming product dripped onto the hood deck surface. The flame at the end of the reactor was ~10-12 inches tall at the highest point. The flame on the deck was ~4-6 inches in height.

The incident occurred behind the lowered sashes in the test hood. No one was injured. The hood was not damaged and the test equipment appears to be fully functional, except for a few thermocouple cables, heat tape, controller power cable and a section of polymer purge tubing that was in the path of the flame.

The building fire alarm was not pulled as the cognizant scientists determined the incident to be isolated, contained and that the fire could be extinguished with the equipment available. One researcher left the area to call for an emergency response while another researcher located the building fire extinguisher (&lt;10ft away) and extinguished the fire with two short bursts. The sash was raised ~12 inches to aim the fire extinguisher discharge at the flame and was pulled back down after successfully suffocating the flame. The flames were extinguished within 15-20 seconds of ignition.
在塞流式反应器中对硅油中的氨硼烷粉浆进行热反应以进行氢气释放实验时,试验反应器上的一个排放口松动了。一种发泡的白色产品从接头处泄漏出来,并向热胶带和隔热材料的方向（反应器的背面）排放。因此,正在发生反应的热浆液从端口流出,暴露在空气中。在氧气的作用下,浆料被点燃,产生绿色火焰。人们注意到泄漏处有一小团绿色火焰,燃烧的产品滴落到机罩甲板表面。反应器末端的火焰最高处约有 10-12 英寸高。甲板上的火焰高度约为 4-6 英寸。

事故发生在试验气罩中放下的窗扇后面。无人受伤。除了一些热电偶电缆,热胶带,控制器电源电缆和一段位于火焰路径上的聚合物净化管之外,测试罩没有损坏,测试设备似乎也完全正常。

大楼的火警警报没有被拉响,因为科学家们认为事故是孤立的,受到控制的,而且用现有的设备可以将火扑灭。一名研究人员离开该区域呼叫应急响应,另一名研究人员找到了建筑物灭火器（10 英尺远）,并用两次短促的喷射将火扑灭。窗扇被抬起约 12 英寸,以便将灭火器的出水口对准火焰,在成功熄灭火焰后又被拉了下来。火焰在点火后 15-20 秒内被扑灭。","(Spontaneous combustion)

Catalyst regeneration is a periodically performed procedure, in which the normal liquid hydrocarbon feed is stopped and a hydrogen-rich gas mixture is fed through the catalyst bed for which the normal operating temperature is raised from 700F to 800F. During the catalyst regeneration process the reactor pressure is increased from normal operating levels just below 600 psig to about 640 psig. A pipe failure occurred as a sudden and complete rupture of the 10-inch diameter line at the exit of one of the two reactors. Security video revealed that the release rapidly exapnded and the hot gas mixture ignited shortly after rupture. A shock wave from the resulting explosion expanded through the adjacent neighborhood, causing varied degrees of blast damage to residential homes. Four workers near the process unit at the time of the explosion were not seriously injured.

An earlier process report indicated that sulfiding was conducted to activate the catalyst several years prior to this incident. As well, sulfidation corrosion is a known issue in oil refinery process streams operating between 450F and 1000F where sulfur of H2S is present. Evidence suggests sulfidation corrosion as the primary cause of the wall thinning that resulted in the rupture and that turbulent flow at an elbow likely caused the most significant wall thinning at the rupture location just downstream of that elbow.

Quantitative analysis of piping and elbow specimens were consistent with specifications current in 1966 for ASTM A213 Grades T11 and T12 alloy steels.
一家炼油厂的馏分脱蜡装置在进行催化剂热氢再生时发生爆炸。催化剂再生是一个定期进行的过程,在这个过程中,正常的液态碳氢化合物进料被停止,富氢气体混合物被送入催化剂床层,催化剂床层的正常工作温度从 700F 升至 800F。在催化剂再生过程中,反应器的压力从正常工作水平略低于 600 psig 提高到约 640 psig。管道故障发生时,两个反应器中的一个出口处直径为 10 英寸的管道突然完全破裂。监控录像显示,管道破裂后不久,高温气体混合物迅速外泄并被点燃。爆炸产生的冲击波波及附近的居民区,对居民住宅造成了不同程度的爆炸破坏。爆炸发生时,加工装置附近的四名工人没有严重受伤。

早前的一份工艺报告显示,在此次事件发生的几年前,曾进行过硫化处理以激活催化剂。此外,硫化腐蚀也是炼油厂工艺流程中存在 H2S 硫的 450F 至 1000F 操作过程中的一个已知问题。有证据表明,硫化腐蚀是造成管壁变薄并导致破裂的主要原因,而弯头处的湍流很可能是弯头下游破裂位置管壁变薄的主要原因。

Revisions to recommended practices should be considered regarding the use of carbon steel in HTHA-susceptible service and the verification of actual operating conditions.	Given the difficulty of inspecting for HTHA because the damage might not be detected, inherently safer design is a better approach to prevent HTHA.	Process hazards analysis (PHA) and damage mechanism hazard reviews (DMHRs) need to carefully consider all assumptions, periodically if necessary, to ensure that hazard identification, safeguards and control of hazards to prevent equipment failure are effective.	Effective programs need to be in place to manage and provide oversight for hazardous nonroutine work.

Hydrogen and naphtha at more than 500F were released from the ruptured heat exchanger and ignited, causing an explosion and an intense fire burned for more than three hours.

The rupture fatally injured seven employees working in the immediate vicinity of heat exchanger at the time of the incident. The workers were in the final stages of a start-up activity to put a parallel bank of three heat exchangers back in service following cleaning. Such start-up activities had resulted in frequent leaks and occasional fires in the past and should have been considered as hazardous and nonroutine.

The damage of the specific heat exchanger was the result of its carbon steel being severly weakened by HTHA, a mechanism that results in fissures and cracking which occurs when the material is exposed to hydrogen at high temperatures and pressures, severely degarding the mechanical properties of the steel. API Recommended Practice 941 (Steels for Hydrogen Service at Elevated Temperatures and pressures in Petroleum Refnieries and Petrochemical Plants) provides Nelson curves to predict the occurrence of HTHA in various materials of construction. These curves are predicated on past equipment failure incidents and are plotted based upon self-reported process conditions. An investigative computer reconstruction of the ruptured heat exchanger estimated that exchanger was operating in a safe region of the Nelson curves where HTHA could not occur. API Recommended Practice 581 (Risk-Based Inspection Technology) allows users to calculate a damage factor to determine HTHA susceptibility of various materials of construction, rather than requiring users to actually verify operating conditions when determining applicable damage mechanisms.
一家石油精炼厂的催化重整装置/石脑油加氢装置的三组热交换器中的一组因高温氢气侵蚀 (HTHA) 而发生灾难性破裂。氢气和温度超过 500F 的石脑油从破裂的热交换器中释放出来并被点燃,引起爆炸,大火燃烧了三个多小时。

事故发生时,在热交换器附近工作的七名员工因热交换器破裂而致命受伤。这些工人当时正处于启动活动的最后阶段,以便在清洗后将一组平行的三个热交换器重新投入使用。过去,此类启动活动曾导致频繁泄漏和偶发火灾,因此应被视为危险和非例行活动。

特定热交换器的损坏是其碳钢被 HTHA 严重削弱的结果,HTHA 是一种导致裂缝和开裂的机制,当材料暴露在高温高压的氢气中时就会产生裂缝和开裂,严重降低钢的机械性能。API 推荐规范 941（石油精炼厂和石化厂高温高压氢气工况用钢）提供了纳尔逊曲线,用于预测各种结构材料中 HTHA 的发生率。这些曲线以过去的设备故障事件为基础,并根据自我报告的工艺条件绘制而成。对破裂的换热器进行的计算机重建调查估计,换热器是在纳尔逊曲线的安全区域内运行的,在该区域内不会发生 HTHA。API 推荐实践 581（基于风险的检查技术）允许用户计算损坏系数,以确定各种结构材料对 HTHA 的敏感性,而不是要求用户在确定适用的损坏机制时实际验证运行条件。","(Spontaneous combustion)

Four chemical reactor chambers in series were being emptied of liquid using hydrogen gas as part of a maintenance procedure. Two heater valves were opened allowing 3000 psi hydrogen to flow in reverse direction to purge the reactor system for approximately 25 minutes. At completion of the purging process, a ""light"" thud was heard as the reactor empty-out valves are being closed. Smoky vapor was observed coming out of one of the reactor empty-out valves and the valve closing was stopped by the operator. The operator summoned a second operator for help at which time a second ""loud"" thud was heard with a much larger light and dark gray vapor cloud observed coming from the leaking valve. Both operators evacuated the area and proceed to shut off the fuel supply and lower the reactor system hydrogen pressure.

Approximately two minutes after the start of this incident, the vapor cloud from the valve was replaced by a large yellow and green flame that initially engulfed a nearby separator and tank. Plant personnel began emergency fire response procedures that included closing valves to shut off hydrogen and natural gas supplies, starting the local fire fighting deluge system, bringing in an additional large fire hose, and making an emergency call to the off-site fire department. Plant personnel quenched the fire prior to arrival of the fire department. Full emergency response and incident command was established until area was declared safe. An estimated 40 lbs of hydrogen gas was released in this incident. No personnel were injured in this incident but some minor damage to nearby equipment occurred.

After the incident, the leaking valve was removed and replaced. The leaking valve was disassembled for forensic analysis. The cause of the valve failure was determined to be a packing leak in the reactor empty-out valve. The remaining valve packing was sent to vendor for failure analysis. The metallurgy of the leaking valve components was verified as being correct. Valve installation standards, specification, and records were retrieved but there was no vendor specification or standard for the valve packing.
一家化工厂在计划停机维护期间发生阀门故障,导致氢气从阀门泄漏并起火。作为维护程序的一部分,四个串联的化学反应室正在使用氢气排空液体。两个加热器阀门被打开,3000 psi 的氢气逆向流动,对反应器系统进行了约 25 分钟的吹扫。清洗过程结束后,反应器排空阀门关闭时,听到 ""轻微 ""的砰砰声。观察到烟雾状蒸汽从一个反应器排空阀中喷出,操作员停止了阀门的关闭。操作员向另一名操作员求助,此时又听到 ""砰 ""的一声巨响,并观察到从泄漏阀门中冒出更大的浅灰色和深灰色蒸汽云。两名操作员都撤离了该区域,并开始关闭燃料供应,降低反应堆系统的氢气压力。

事件发生约两分钟后,从阀门喷出的蒸汽云被巨大的黄色和绿色火焰所取代,火焰最初吞没了附近的分离器和储罐。工厂工作人员开始执行紧急火灾应对程序,包括关闭阀门以切断氢气和天然气供应,启动当地消防排水系统,增调大型消防水龙带以及向场外消防队拨打紧急电话。工厂工作人员在消防队到达之前扑灭了大火。在宣布该区域安全之前,建立了全面的应急响应和事故指挥系统。这次事故估计释放了 40 磅氢气。事故中没有人员受伤,但附近的设备受到轻微损坏。

事件发生后,泄漏阀门被拆除和更换。泄漏的阀门被拆卸下来进行取证分析。阀门故障的原因被确定为反应堆排空阀的填料泄漏。剩余的阀门填料被送往供应商处进行故障分析。经核实,泄漏阀门部件的冶金工艺正确无误。阀门安装标准,规格和记录已被检索,但没有关于阀门填料的供应商规格或标准。","(Spontaneous combustion)

工作人员关注的是 AGES 系统测试和结果,而不是测试设备的兼容性。手动阀门是成功测试系统所必需的,但却忽略了这一特定阀门无法承受全气缸压力的事实。将采取以下纠正措施：评估工程设计与运营系统和程序之间的接口,以管理临时修改工作。制定并实施仪器系统工程设计程序。评估相关设施系统的警报/应急响应程序,必要时进行修订。评估相关设施的楼宇进出培训,以确定警报响应部分的适当性,并在必要时进行修订。这一安全事件表明,临时改装,尤其是系统测试所需的临时改装,应得到与永久改装同等程度的关注和审查。","A partial pressure sensor for an automated gas environment system (AGES) was not functioning correctly for pure hydrogen flow. While personnel were troubleshooting the problem, a burst disk ruptured resulting in a leak of hydrogen gas and actuation of a flammable gas alarm.

System troubleshooting involved the installation of a small hydrogen gas cylinder and temporary manual valve in an engineered ventilated enclosure adjacent to an instrument sample well. A burst disk associated with the temporary manual valve ruptured upon opening of the gas cylinder valve. The vented gas, exhausting through an engineered exhaust system, triggered the flammable gas detector. Personnel promptly evacuated the area in accordance with established procedures. Appropriate personnel responded to the event, established a safe condition and made appropriate notifications. There were no injuries or other environmental, health and safety impacts associated with this event.

The ventilated enclosure, a hazardous gas cabinet, is designed to contain and exhaust hazardous gases from the building should a leak develop during the conduct of experiments. Input gases are normally fed into the cabinet from an outlying cylinder shed. The external line to the hazardous gas cabinet enters the cabinet and connects to a three-way block. The output of the block connects to a regulator that feeds the gas flow control system. The ""spare"" third block connection is normally plugged.

For testing, a small bottle of ultra-high purity (UHP) hydrogen gas was installed into the hazardous gas cabinet. The bottle was connected to the ""spare"" third block connection through a high-end manual valve. The input from the cylinder shed was manually isolated. The temporary manual valve could be opened to facilitate evacuation of atmospheric gas contaminants prior to opening the clean bottle of hydrogen, thus ensuring system integrity.

Temporary modifications to the AGES system were documented in an approved test plan and on a ""red-line"" of existing, approved process and instrument diagram (P&amp;ID) drawings. During the testing, system as-built drawings were being re-verified and details discovered during testing documented within the test plan.

SUMMARY OF IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN:

- Evacuated the immediate area.

- Gas bottle isolated and testing suspended.

- Responding personnel verified conditions safe for reentry.

- An investigation was initiated and critique conducted on the following day.

DISCUSSION OF CAUSE: The temporary manual valve selected for testing of the automated gas environment system (AGES) had an integral burst disk rated at 1900 psi +/- 100 psi. This is an unusual valve configuration, typically used for cryogenic service. The valve was an on-hand spare, but the documentation of the burst disk feature was not available. It was not recognized that the burst disk was an integral part of the valve. The pressure in the small UHP hydrogen bottle was approximately 2015 psi. The regulator downstream of the gas bottle is rated for 3000 psi input, so it could accommodate the bottle's supply pressure. The direct cause of this event was the improper selection of the manual valve with integral burst disk rated below the bottle supply pressure for this temporary testing configuration.

Personnel were focused on the AGES system test and results, not the compatibility of the test equipment. The manual valve was needed to successfully test the system, however the fact that this particular valve could not accommodate the full cylinder pressure was overlooked.
用于自动气体环境系统（AGES）的分压传感器在纯氢气流中无法正常工作。当工作人员正在排除故障时,一个爆破片破裂,导致氢气泄漏并触发了可燃气体警报。

系统故障排除工作包括在仪器采样井旁边的工程通风罩内安装一个小型氢气瓶和临时手动阀门。气瓶阀门打开时,与临时手动阀门相关的爆破片破裂。通过工程排气系统排出的气体触发了可燃气体探测器。工作人员按照既定程序迅速撤离了该区域。相关人员对事件做出了反应,建立了安全状态,并发出了适当的通知。此次事件未造成人员伤亡或其他环境,健康和安全影响。

通风围栏是一个危险气体柜,其设计目的是在实验过程中发生泄漏时,将危险气体封闭并排出大楼。输入气体通常从外围的气瓶棚送入柜内。通往危险气柜的外部管线进入气柜后连接到一个三通阀。该模块的输出端连接到为气体流量控制系统供气的调节器。备用 ""第三块连接通常是插接的。

为了进行测试,在危险气体柜中安装了一小瓶超高纯（UHP）氢气。氢气瓶通过一个高端手动阀门与 ""备用 ""第三区块连接。气瓶棚的输入被手动隔离。在打开干净的氢气瓶之前,可以打开临时手动阀门,以便排出大气中的气体污染物,从而确保系统的完整性。

对 AGES 系统的临时修改记录在经批准的测试计划和现有的,经批准的流程和仪器图 (P&amp;ID) 的 ""红线 ""上。在测试期间,对系统竣工图进行了重新核实,并将测试期间发现的细节记录在测试计划中。

立即采取的行动摘要

- 疏散附近区域。

- 隔离气瓶并暂停测试。

- 应对人员核实了重新进入的安全条件。

- 第二天开始进行调查和批评。

原因分析：为测试自动气体环境系统（AGES）而选择的临时手动阀门有一个额定值为 1900 psi +/- 100 psi 的内置爆破片。这是一种不寻常的阀门配置,通常用于低温服务。该阀门是现成的备用件,但没有关于爆破片功能的文件。人们没有认识到爆破片是阀门的一个组成部分。小型超高压氢气瓶中的压力约为 2015 psi。气瓶下游的调节器额定输入压力为 3000 psi,因此可以承受气瓶的供应压力。造成这一事件的直接原因是,在此临时测试配置中,带内置爆破片的手动阀门的额定值低于瓶子的供应压力,选择不当。

工作人员只关注 AGES 系统的测试和结果,而不是测试设备的兼容性。手动阀门是成功测试系统所必需的,但却忽略了这一特定阀门无法承受全气瓶压力的事实。","(Spontaneous combustion)

氢气供应商在高压氢气储存库旁安装了防火材料板,以防止任何潜在的喷射火焰在几分钟内影响相邻的高压气瓶。这种 0.25 毫米的玻璃纤维增强轻质混凝土夹层板易于维护,在外部条件下也不会腐烂。这项安全措施虽然计划已久,但在事故发生三天后才开始实施。氢气供应商安装了一个半自动喷淋系统,用于冷却高压氢气储存库,以防止任何可能逸出的氢气点燃喷射火焰,影响其他氢气钢瓶。此外,高压储氢罐上方的干式管道系统可在高压储氢罐发生火灾或泄漏时由消防部门用水浇灌。警报系统经过改进,可自动向相关人员发送气体/火灾警报信息。服务人员监控加氢站的远程控制室现在配备了额外的音频系统,以更快地引起对警报的注意。所有计划和应急程序都经过了审查,调整和编辑,以记录变化并充分吸取经验教训。其他收获： 建议进行最坏情况的培训,以便为这些情况做好准备。","An alarm sounded at a recently inaugurated hydrogen fueling station in a major metropolitan area. One out of a total of 120 high-pressure hydrogen cylinders, located on the roof of the fueling station, failed in service. Gaseous hydrogen was leaking from a screw fitting of the cylinder, but the hydrogen was not ignited. Three hydrogen gas sensors detected the leakage and triggered an alarm that resulted in an immediate emergency shutdown, isolating the leaking high-pressure cylinder bank from the other three banks and notifying the local fire department. No personnel were allowed to enter the roof area, approximately 7-9 meters above ground level.

The police isolated the area around the fueling station within a radius of 200 meters. The maximum content of the leaking cylinder bank was determined to be ~ 70 kg of hydrogen at 800 bar. The leak rate at the high-pressure storage bank was ~5 kg/hr.

After 2.5 hours, the hydrogen supplier's technician manually opened a bypass line to let the hydrogen escape through a vent line. This action was taken from the ground-floor control room well outside an area that might have exposed personnel to additional hazards.

About four hours later, the leaking high-pressure bank was essentially empty, with a pressure of around 1 bar. The cylinder with the failed teflon-sealed screw fitting was sealed with a plug with the intention of never using it again. There was no threat to employees or the public from this incident.
在一个大都市地区最近落成的氢气加氢站,警报声响起。加氢站屋顶上共有 120 个高压氢气瓶,其中一个在使用过程中发生故障。气态氢从气瓶的一个螺纹接头处泄漏,但氢气没有被点燃。三个氢气传感器检测到泄漏并触发警报,导致立即紧急关闭,将泄漏的高压气瓶组与其他三个气瓶组隔离,并通知当地消防部门。任何人员都不得进入离地面约 7-9 米高的屋顶区域。

警方隔离了加氢站周围半径 200 米的区域。经测定,在 800 巴压力下,泄漏气瓶组的最大氢气含量约为 70 千克。高压储存库的泄漏率为 ~5 公斤/小时。

2. 5 小时后,氢气供应商的技术人员手动打开了一条旁路管线,让氢气通过通风管线泄漏。这一操作是在地面控制室进行的,而控制室远在人员可能面临更多危险的区域之外。

大约四小时后,泄漏的高压储氢罐基本上空了,压力约为 1 巴。装有失效的聚四氟乙烯密封螺纹接头的气缸已用塞子密封,打算永远不再使用。此次事件没有对员工或公众造成威胁。","(Spontaneous combustion)

These problems could have been avoided by adequate quality assurance/quality control procedures during the design and safety reviews.The canopy was added to the station as an afterthought, sometime following the HazOps review. The prestart-up safety review by all parties and the local authority having jurisdiction did not recognize the setback distance of the canopy. Had an engineering management of change, follow-up HazOp or other form of risk assessment been conducted, it is likely that the vent stacks adjacent to the canopy would have been raised in order to avoid any damage in the event of a fire.Prior to reopening the station, physical changes were made using the correct PRD valves and higher vent stacks, and new and modified procedures were instituted to improve the timely communication of station status during emergency events. Additional training of personnel focused on improving the response time and effective communication between employees, first responders, and the hydrogen equipment supplier.
调查中发现了三个根本原因：(1) 制造泄压装置 (PRD) 阀门时使用了不兼容的材料；(2) 装配不当导致内部组件扭矩过大；(3) 阀门制造商对内部组件材料过度硬化。如果在设计和安全审查过程中采取适当的质量保证/质量控制程序,这些问题是可以避免的。顶篷是在 HazOps 审查之后的某个时间才临时加装的。所有各方和具有管辖权的地方当局在启动前的安全审查中都没有确认顶篷的后退距离。如果当时进行了工程变更管理,后续的 HazOp 或其他形式的风险评估,很可能就会抬高毗邻顶篷的通风管道,以避免在发生火灾时造成任何损害。在重新开放加油站之前,使用了正确的泄压装置（PRD）阀门和更高的排气烟囱进行了物理改 变,并制定了新的和修改后的程序,以改善紧急情况下加油站状态的及时沟通。对人员进行了额外培训,重点是改善反应时间以及员工,急救人员和氢气设备供应商之间的有效沟通。","A pressure relief device (PRD) valve failed on a high-pressure storage tube at a hydrogen fueling station, causing the release of approximately 300 kilograms of hydrogen gas. The gas ignited at the exit of the vent pipe and burned for 2-1/2 hours until technicians were permitted by the local fire department to enter the station and stop the flow of gas. During this incident the fire department evacuated nearby businesses and an elementary school, closed adjacent streets, and ordered a high school to shelter in place.

There were no injuries and very little property damage. The corrugated roof on an adjacent canopy over a fueling dispenser was slightly singed by the escaping hydrogen flame, causing less than $300 in damage.

The station's operating systems worked as they were designed to function in an emergency. All equipment and fuel supplies were completely isolated, and all storage vessels were well within acceptable and safe pressure and temperature limits prior to and throughout the incident.

After a thorough analysis of the incident was conducted, corrective actions were taken to replace PRD valves, heighten vent stacks, modify response procedures and improve communication protocols with first responders. A considerable amount of time was taken to review the station design, evaluate emergency action plans and procedures, meet with the public, train first responders, and conduct follow-up drills with employees and first responders. The station reopened nine months after the incident and has been fully operational since that time.
加氢站高压储存管上的压力释放装置 (PRD) 阀门发生故障,导致约 300 公斤氢气泄漏。气体在排气管出口处被点燃,并燃烧了 2-1 个半小时,直到当地消防部门允许技术人员进入加氢站并停止气体流动。在这次事故中,消防部门疏散了附近的企业和一所小学,关闭了附近的街道,并命令一所中学就地避难。

事故中没有人员伤亡,财产损失也很小。邻近一个加氢加油机顶棚上的波纹屋顶被逸散的氢气火焰轻微烧焦,造成的损失不到 300 美元。

加油站的操作系统按照设计在紧急情况下运行。所有设备和燃料供应都完全隔离,所有储存容器在事件发生之前和整个过程中都在可接受的安全压力和温度范围内。

在对事故进行彻底分析后,采取了纠正措施,更换了泄压装置 (PRD) 阀门,加高了通风管道,修改了应对程序,并改进了与急救人员的通信协议。我们花费了大量的时间来审查车站的设计,评估应急行动计划和程序,与公众会面,培训急救人员,并对员工和急救人员进行后续演练。事件发生九个月后,车站重新开放,并一直全面运营。","(Spontaneous combustion)

运行期间","Because the bottle was located outside at the time of the event, and the hydrogen did not find a source of ignition while venting through the relief valve, nothing serious happened. The failed regulator was replaced and operations continued. However, if this had happened indoors or an otherwise enclosed space, the outcome could have been much worse.The installed pressure relief valve and the small size of the orifice in the regulator (although allowing high-pressure gas to the low-pressure side of the regulator the mass flow rate is rather low) should be adequate protection of the rest of the system.The key aspects of what can be learned from this near-miss can be emphasized as follows:	A regulator is not a safety device. Without additional protection, downstream components can be exposed to pressures exceeding the set pressure up to the full bottle pressure. If items downstream of the regulator are not rated for full bottle pressure, it is recommended that protection be added to the system.	Pressure relief device discharges need to be routed to a safe location. In the event of a pressure relieving event, it is important for the flow to be directed away from personnel, preferably such that the shut-off valve can be accessed safely.	Adequate ventilation is an important consideration in the layout of a compressed gas system. Inert gases (as potential asphyxiants), toxic and flammable gases can pose a significant hazard if not properly ventilated.
由于事发时瓶子位于室外,而且氢气在通过溢流阀排出时没有找到火源,因此没有发生严重事故。发生故障的调节器被更换,运行继续进行。但是,如果事故发生在室内或其他密闭空间,结果可能会更糟。已安装的泄压阀和调压器中的小孔（虽然允许高压气体进入调压器的低压侧,但质量流量相当低）应足以保护系统的其余部分。从这起险情中可以吸取的教训主要有以下几个方面：调压器不是安全装置。如果没有额外的保护措施,下游部件可能会暴露在超过设定压力直至满瓶压力的压力下。如果调节器下游部件的额定压力未达到满瓶压力,建议在系统中增加保护装置。泄压装置的排出物需要输送到安全位置。在发生泄压事件时,必须将水流引向远离人员的地方,最好是能够安全地接触到截止阀。充足的通风是压缩气体系统布局的一个重要考虑因素。如果通风不当,惰性气体（潜在窒息物）,有毒气体和易燃气体会造成严重危害。","A single-stage regulator ""failed"" while flowing hydrogen gas from a standard 200 cu.ft. gas bottle. The regulator had functioned properly prior to the event through several on-off cycles. During the event, a solenoid valve was opened to allow hydrogen to flow, when a rather loud noise was noted and gas began flowing out of the pressure relief valve on the side of the regulator. It was noted that the low-pressure gauge on the regulator was ""pegged"" at the high side (&gt;200 psi). The valve on the bottle was shut off, and hydrogen flow was immediately stopped. Hydrogen flowing out of the relief valve did not ignite. With the bottle shut off, the regulator was removed and replaced with another regulator of the same type, and activities continued.

The failed regulator was later taken apart to try to determine the cause of failure. All the internal parts appeared to be intact with the exception of a small elastomeric ring that seals the internal ""nozzle"" to the ""seat assembly."" This elastomeric ring was deformed and had become lodged in the nozzle orifice, preventing the seat assembly from properly seating and allowing high pressure hydrogen to continuously flow into the low-pressure side of the regulator. The regulator has a pressure relief valve as protection and it operated properly, relieving the pressure in the system. Fortunately, nothing downstream of the regulator was damaged. It is not known what led to the failure of the elastomer ring.

The manufacturer was contacted, and the event/observations were described and discussed. Damage to the elastomeric ring on that valve stem, thus limiting its ability ro seal, is a rare event. The ring material was specifically selected for hydrogen/methane service and subjected to tens of thousands of open-close cycles. The manufacturer doesn't require a periodic maintenance program for these regulators but occasional replacement of the elastomer seal and o-ring on the outer part of the regulator body is recommended.
一个单级调节器在从标准 200 立方英尺气瓶中输送氢气时发生 ""故障""。事件发生前,该调节器经过几次开关循环后一直正常工作。事件发生时,电磁阀被打开以允许氢气流出,此时发出一声巨响,气体开始从调压器一侧的泄压阀流出。人们注意到,调压器上的低压表 ""锁定 ""在高压侧（200 psi）。瓶子上的阀门被关闭,氢气立即停止流动。从溢流阀流出的氢气没有被点燃。随着瓶子的关闭,调节器被拆下,换上另一个同型号的调节器,活动继续进行。

后来拆开了失灵的调节器,试图确定失灵的原因。所有内部零件似乎都完好无损,只有一个将内部 ""喷嘴 ""与 ""阀座组件 ""密封的弹性小环除外。""这个弹性环已经变形,卡在喷嘴孔中,导致阀座组件无法正常就位,高压氢气不断流入调节器的低压侧。调节器有一个泄压阀作为保护,该阀运行正常,释放了系统中的压力。幸运的是,调节器下游没有任何损坏。目前尚不清楚是什么原因导致弹性环失效。

我们联系了制造商,并对事件/观察结果进行了描述和讨论。该阀杆上的弹性环损坏,从而限制了其密封能力,这种情况非常罕见。阀环材料是专门为氢气/甲烷服务而选择的,并经历了数万次开闭循环。制造商不要求对这些调压器进行定期维护,但建议偶尔更换调压器外部的弹性密封和 O 形圈。","(Spontaneous combustion)

Sources of liquid oxygen could be air ingress or oxygen impurity being entrained in the main gas to be purified/liquefied.Potential ignition mechanisms/sources (e.g., electric heaters used for regeneration).Use of alternative/substitute adsorbent that is noncombustible with liquid oxygen (e.g., silica gel, molecular sieve).Add an oxygen trap (e.g., silica gel, liquid nitrogen trap/knockout pot system) upstream of the activated carbon adsorbent bed.Avoid having sudden flow or pressure changes through the activated carbon adsorber, since these would increase the likelihood of ignition.Use sensors to identify the presence of oxygen or air ingress upstream and actuate alarms or system emergency stop when concentrations exceed predetermined set points.Purge the adsorber bed with an inert gas to reduce the risk of ignition if high oxygen concentrations are present.Alternatively, pull a vacuum on the adsorber to remove any adsorbed oxygen before the adsorber is put back online.Look for alternatives to or add-on features for pressure-reducing devices.Years of satisfactory service without incident should not be taken as proof of safe operation of cryogenic activated carbon adsorbers.

The explosion took place in the nitrogen cold box section of the hydrogen liquefaction process in an activated carbon cold adsorber vessel. Process records showed that the explosion occurred at the beginning of the regeneration phase of the activated carbon adsorber. When the explosion took place, the outlet temperature of the activated carbon bed was still at -190C. The force of the explosion was estimated from a mapping of the debris to be between 10 and 100 kg TNT equivalent.Activated carbon is a general term that covers carbon material mostly derived from charcoal. It has an exceptionally high surface area and can adsorb large quantities of gases. It is believed that condensation of an oxygen-enriched phase occurred and reacted with the activated carbon adsorbent, resulting in an explosion. The root causes of the explosion were:The catalyst used in the oxygen reduction system upstream of the hydrogen purifier was rapidly inhibited during operation, most likely due to an unexpected contaminant in the feed from the unpurified hydrogen source.As a result, oxygen passed downstream into the purification section and was adsorbed on the activated carbon of the cold adsorbers.The regeneration blower generated a spark, which ignited a hydrogen/oxygen mixture and triggered a flashback to the adsorber bed.The explosion in the adsorber vessel was caused by the activated carbon reaction with the adsorbed oxygen.The safety relief valves were found to be operational after the explosions. This indicates that the reaction leading to the explosion was so rapid that the purifier vessel could not be protected by conventional pressure relief devices (PRDs). In other words, the reaction was much faster than PRD actuation and opening time.The ignition mechanism of this incident is not fully understood. However, it is known that activated carbon in the presence of condensed oxygen or liquid air is an unstable combination that can result in a powerful explosion. One kg of oxygen adsorbed in activated carbon is said to be 2.6 times more powerful than an equivalent weight of TNT.Potential ignition sources include:Presence of high temperature or hot spot during adsorbent regeneration.Impact of particles entrained in the gas stream.Rapid flow change through the bed (e.g., during operation of process flow valves).Heat generated by adiabatic compression.
1987 年投入使用的一个氢液化器/纯化器发生了爆炸,而该氢液化器/纯化器此前已安全运行多年。爆炸发生在活性炭冷吸附器容器中氢气液化过程的氮气冷箱部分。工艺记录显示,爆炸发生在活性炭吸附器再生阶段的开始。爆炸发生时,活性炭床的出口温度仍为 -190 摄氏度。根据对碎片的测绘,估计爆炸威力在 10 至 100 千克 TNT 当量之间。活性炭是一个笼统的术语,包括主要来自木炭的碳材料。它具有极高的表面积,可以吸附大量气体。据信,富氧相凝结后与活性炭吸附剂发生反应,导致爆炸。爆炸的根本原因是：氢气纯化器上游氧气还原系统中使用的催化剂在运行过程中被迅速抑制,这很可能是由于来自未纯化氢源的进料中存在意外污染物。因此,氧气从下游进入净化部分,并吸附在冷吸附器的活性炭上。再生鼓风机产生的火花点燃了氢/氧混合物,并引发了吸附器床层的回火。吸附器容器内的爆炸是由活性炭与吸附的氧气反应引起的。爆炸发生后,发现安全泄压阀仍在工作。这表明,导致爆炸的反应速度非常快,常规泄压装置无法保护净化器容器。换句话说,反应速度远远快于压力释放装置的启动和开启时间。此次事件的点火机制尚不完全清楚。不过,众所周知,活性炭在有冷凝氧气或液态空气的情况下是一种不稳定的组合,可导致强烈爆炸。据说,活性炭中吸附的一公斤氧气的威力是同等重量 TNT 的 2.6 倍。潜在的点火源包括：吸附剂再生过程中出现高温或热点。气流中夹带颗粒的影响。通过床层的快速流量变化（例如,在操作工艺流程阀门时）。绝热压缩产生的热量。","(Spontaneous combustion)

运行期间","As stated on the MSDS and also on the container labels, LiAlH4 should be handled under argon. LiAlH4 is advertised and sold as a powder. If the researcher had to scrape it out of the jar, then it was no longer a powder, which seems indicative of past reaction that may have been due to exposure to atmospheric moisture.The manufacturer stated that they do not have any first-hand data suggesting that friction alone could cause ignition. All of their handling of LiAlH4 is performed inside a glove bag under an argon atmosphere, so they have never had a fire during the packaging process. They recommend handling LiAlH4 under argon in a glove box or glove bag to minimize oxygen and moisture contact and, therefore, minimize the chance of a fire.The university ES&amp;H department did some searching online and found several relevant websites that provide confirmation that friction alone in the presence of air may be able to ignite LiAlH4.http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/989http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB7318252.htmhttp://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/dmt_synthesis1.shtml (scroll down to step 3)http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/labsafetymanual/cheminfo/lah.htmSince the university has adopted the following standard operating procedures, there has not been a reoccurrence of this type of incident:	Only non-metal spatulas are to be used with metal hydrides.	All work with metal hydrides must be done under an inert gas atmosphere (either argon or nitrogen).
如材料安全数据表和容器标签所述,LiAlH4 应在氩气环境下处理。LiAlH4 是作为粉末宣传和销售的。如果研究人员不得不把它从罐子里刮出来,那么它就不再是粉末了,这似乎表明过去的反应可能是由于暴露在大气湿气中造成的。制造商表示,他们没有任何第一手数据表明仅摩擦就能引起燃烧。他们对 LiAlH4 的所有处理都是在氩气环境下在手套袋内进行的,因此在包装过程中从未发生过火灾。他们建议在手套箱或手套袋中的氩气环境下处理 LiAlH4,以尽量减少氧气和湿气的接触,从而将起火的几率降到最低。该大学的 ES&amp;H 部门在网上进行了一些搜索,发现有几个相关网站证实,在空气存在的情况下,仅摩擦就可能点燃 LiAlH4。http://cameochemicals. noaa. gov/chemical/989http://www. chemicalbook. com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB7318252. htmhttp://www. erowid. org/chemicals/dmt/dmt_synthesis1. shtml （向下滚动到第 3 步）http://web. princeton. edu/sites/ehs/labsafetymanual/cheminfo/lah. htm自从学校采用了以下标准操作程序后,此类事件就没有再发生过：金属氢化物只能使用非金属抹刀。所有使用金属氢化物的工作都必须在惰性气体（氩气或氮气）环境下进行。","A university researcher reported that a fire resulted when he scraped lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) out of the glass jar in which it was contained (see attached photo). The jar had been in the laboratory since 2005 (about 6 years), so the LiAlH4 was old. The researcher was using a dry metal spatula to scrape the LiAlH4 out of the jar. A quick review of the manufacturer's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for LiAlH4 informed the researcher of its moisture sensitivity, but there was no indication of friction causing a fire. However, the supervising faculty member reported personal knowledge that friction can cause ignition of LiAlH4.

The fire was put out with an ABC extinguisher. In the attached photo, the ABC extinguishing agent is the yellow powder.
一位大学研究人员报告说,当他从装有氢化铝锂（LiAlH4）的玻璃瓶中刮出锂时,引发了火灾（见附图）。该玻璃瓶自 2005 年（约 6 年）起就一直放在实验室里,因此 LiAlH4 已经很老了。研究人员用一把干燥的金属刮刀将 LiAlH4 从罐子里刮出来。研究人员快速查看了制造商提供的 LiAlH4 材料安全数据表 (MSDS),了解到 LiAlH4 对湿气的敏感性,但没有迹象表明摩擦会引起火灾。不过,指导教师报告说,他个人知道摩擦会导致 LiAlH4 起火。

运行期间","The project team concluded that the jar contained a sufficient vapor pressure of isopropanol to ignite when it came into contact with the decomposing hydride. The lesson learned was that hydrides react rapidly in air and can lead to combustion of any organic vapor that might be present nearby. Thus, the project team adopted a procedure that all hydrides must be submerged in mineral oil before they are removed from the glove box to prevent exposure to air before isopropanol treatment. Since this procedure was adopted for pacification/disposal of hydrides, there have been no more incidents or near-misses of this type in the laboratory.
项目小组得出结论认为,罐子中的异丙醇蒸汽压足以在接触分解的氢化物时点燃。吸取的教训是,氢化物在空气中反应迅速,会导致附近可能存在的任何有机蒸汽燃烧。因此,项目小组采用了一种程序,即所有氢化物在从手套箱中取出之前必须浸没在矿物油中,以防止在异丙醇处理之前暴露在空气中。自从采用了这一程序来安抚/处置氢化物后,实验室再也没有发生过此类事故或险情。","An experienced researcher with 30+ years of laboratory experience (including working with air-sensitive compounds) was disposing of a small vial of catalyst and hydride powder left in the laboratory by a post-doc. The researcher emptied the vial into a container of mineral oil inside a glove box, but a small amount of the hydride powder adhered to the wall of the vial. The vial was then removed from the glove box and brought over to a tall waste jar in the laboratory that contained isopropanol. (Isopropanol is the first (slowest-acting) pacifier used when deactivating pyrophoric hydrides.) The vial was opened and inverted over the isopropanol jar and the residue powder was tapped into the jar. There was a ""small flash of flame"" that quickly extinguished itself.

运行期间","The company investigation revealed that the incident arose because insufficient water was added to the batch. This resulted in a rapid increase in temperature and evolution of hydrogen gas following the addition of aluminum powder in the last seconds of the mix. Despite the presence of a functioning level-control valve on the mixer, the hydrogen gas was ignited when the operator opened the hatch. The most likely source of ignition was the faulty lamp. The operator was acting in accordance with his training and following the company's written safety procedures.The company took a number of measures to prevent a reoccurrence of this incident, including:	 provision of intrinsically safe lamps	 introduction of daily checks of the vent valve	 minor modification to LEV and increased venting throughout the mixing process	 lab testing by the aluminum supplier to evaluate system safety with regard to hydrogen generation for all reaction conditions and quantities of aluminum added	 reprogramming/development of the software to improve both the safety of the operation and operator understanding of warning alarms.
该公司的调查显示,事件发生的原因是批次中加入的水不足。这导致在混合的最后几秒钟加入铝粉后温度迅速升高并产生氢气。尽管混合器上的液位控制阀正常工作,但操作员打开舱门时还是点燃了氢气。最有可能的点火源是故障灯。操作员是按照其所接受的培训和公司的书面安全程序行事的。该公司采取了一系列措施防止事故再次发生,其中包括：提供本质安全型灯具,对排气阀进行每日检查,对 LEV 稍作改动,在整个混合过程中增加排气量,由铝供应商进行实验室测试,以评估在所有反应条件下产生氢气的系统安全性,并增加铝的数量,对软件进行重新编程/开发,以提高操作的安全性和操作员对警报的理解。","A trained operator was blending water, sand, anhydrite, lime, cement, pulverized fly ash, and powdered aluminum in a mixing chamber to produce material for making concrete building blocks. In the blending process, sand and water are mixed to form a slurry, and then the powders are dispensed automatically into the mix by a computer-controlled system. Finally, a slurry of glycol-coated aluminum powder is added in the last few seconds before the mix is discharged into a car, and then molds are filled from the car. Adding aluminum to the mixture results in a small amount of hydrogen gas evolution, which disperses from the car into the surrounding ventilated area and out through roof vents. In addition to being an ingredient of the mix, water also helps to keep the mixture cool.

During a break in production, the operator took the opportunity to wash out the mixer in accordance with his work instructions. He did this by manually emptying out the water hopper, but he neglected to refill the hopper. When he switched the controls back to automatic, the program software did not realize that the hopper was empty since the digital readout still said ""full"".

During the subsequent mixing batch, the operator noticed an ""excessive mix time"" alarm on the mixer panel. This alarm stops the process and dumps the mixer contents. The operator noticed an inconsistency in the mixed material discharge, which was more like a sludge than a fluid concrete. He realized that there must have been a blockage and followed the written procedure by taking manual control and introducing as much water as possible to thin and cool the mix by opening the water hopper valves. During this process, a second alarm went off reading ""mix temperature invalid"", indicating that the mix temperature was not within the acceptable range of 0-99°C.

The operator went up to the mixer platform to investigate the reasons for the alarms and the mix inconsistency. He lifted the mixer inspection hatch and used an inspection lamp (later revealed to be faulty) to illuminate the interior of the mixer. The ensuing explosion resulted in temporary injuries to the operator, including loss of sight, burns, and cuts. He was wearing the correct PPE, including safety glasses and a hard hat, which were both blown off by the blast.

 
一名训练有素的操作员正在混合室中将水,沙子,无水石膏,石灰,水泥,粉煤灰和铝粉混合在一起,以生产用于制作混凝土砌块的材料。在混合过程中,沙子和水混合成浆,然后由计算机控制系统将粉末自动分配到混合料中。最后,在混合料被排入汽车前的最后几秒钟,加入乙二醇涂层铝粉浆,然后从汽车上将模具填满。在混合物中加入铝会产生少量氢气,氢气会从汽车中扩散到周围的通风区域,并通过车顶通风口排出。除了作为混合物的成分,水还有助于保持混合物的冷却。

在生产间歇期间,操作员根据工作说明,趁机清洗了搅拌机。他手动清空了水斗,但却忽略了给水斗加水。当他将控制器切换回自动控制时,程序软件并未意识到水斗已空,因为数字读数仍显示为 ""满""。

在随后的混合批次中,操作员注意到混合器面板上出现了 ""混合时间过长 ""警报。该警报停止了混料过程,并将混料斗中的物料倒出。操作员发现混合材料的排放不一致,更像是淤泥,而不是流动的混凝土。他意识到一定是出现了堵塞,于是按照书面程序进行手动控制,打开水斗阀门,尽可能多地加水稀释和冷却混合料。在此过程中,第二个警报响起,显示 ""混合温度无效"",表明混合温度不在 0-99°C 的可接受范围内。

操作员走上搅拌机平台,调查警报和混合温度不一致的原因。他掀开搅拌机的检查舱门,用一盏检查灯（后来发现有故障）照亮搅拌机内部。随后发生的爆炸导致操作员暂时性受伤,包括失明,烧伤和割伤。他当时佩戴了正确的个人防护设备,包括安全眼镜和防护帽,但都被爆炸炸掉了。

Hydrogen detectors and the fire alarm alerted the control room, which immediately shut down the plant, and the fire was then extinguished rapidly. There were no injuries caused by the accident, since the operator heard a wheezing sound and was able to run away just before the explosion occurred. The leaking gas was composed of 70% hydrogen at a flow rate of 15,000 cubic meters per hour. Property damages in the turbocharger included electrical cabling, melted siding, and heavily damaged pipes. The ammonia plant was shut down for more than a month.Five days before the incident, a problem with the CO2 absorber column led operators to open the vent downstream of the column. In retrospect, this excessive venting was an operational error. It caused a reduction in the suction pressure of the ammonia synthesis turbocharger and the activation of the plant emergency stop. The relief valve on the line between the turbocharger and the methanation reactor was then exposed to high pressure, causing it to open without the operator noticing. Production resumed the next day, but abnormal consumption of syngas led the operator to conduct further investigations. He discovered that the valve was no longer leak-proof and was allowing the gas to escape through a 47-meter chimney. The plant was shut down again to replace the relief valve.When the plant was restarted, the methanation reaction was initiated at 10:00 PM, the synthesis turbocharger started operating at 1:30 AM, and the incident occurred at 3:14 AM on the flange of the newly installed 6-inch-diameter valve. The incident was caused by vibrations in the relief valve, resulting in the quick release of the flange screws, which were probably not tightened sufficiently. In addition, when the relief valve was replaced, it was probably under-calibrated.
一家合成氨生产厂的 6 英寸合成涡轮增压器阀门法兰处发生氢气泄漏,引燃并爆炸。氢气探测器和火灾报警器向控制室发出警报,控制室立即关闭了工厂,随后大火被迅速扑灭。事故没有造成人员伤亡,因为操作员在爆炸发生前听到了喘息声并得以逃离。泄漏的气体由 70% 的氢气组成,流量为每小时 15,000 立方米。涡轮增压器的财产损失包括电缆,融化的护墙板和严重受损的管道。合成氨厂停产一个多月。事故发生五天前,二氧化碳吸收塔出现问题,导致操作员打开了吸收塔下游的通风口。现在回想起来,过度通风是一个操作失误。它导致氨合成涡轮增压器的吸入压力降低,并启动了工厂紧急停车装置。随后,涡轮增压器和甲烷化反应器之间管线上的溢流阀暴露在高压下,导致溢流阀在操作员未察觉的情况下打开。第二天生产恢复,但合成气消耗量异常,导致操作员进行进一步调查。他发现阀门已不再防漏,气体正通过 47 米长的烟囱泄漏。工厂再次关闭,以更换泄压阀。当工厂重新启动时,甲烷化反应于晚上 10:00 开始,合成涡轮增压器于凌晨 1:30 开始运行,而事故发生在凌晨 3:14 新安装的 6 英寸直径阀门的法兰上。事故原因是溢流阀发生振动,导致法兰螺钉快速松开,而螺钉可能没有充分拧紧。此外,在更换溢流阀时,很可能校准不足。","(Spontaneous combustion)

这起事故是多种因素综合作用的结果,导致出现异常的温度条件,而反应堆的机械设计并未考虑到这些因素。核电厂管理层采取的纠正措施包括：重新确定法兰的适当紧固扭矩；改进法兰上泄漏收集器的设计（该收集器在事故中失效）；在泄漏收集器中安装氮气喷射系统；安装蒸汽喷射系统,以保护合成反应堆的底部。","During restart of an ammonia production plant, syngas (50% hydrogen mixed with methane, ammonia, and nitrogen) leaking from a flange directly downstream of the synthesis reactor ignited. The plant had been shut down for about 90 minutes due to a technical problem. Alerted by the plant fire alarm, the operator activated the emergency shutdown, which isolated and depressurized the synthesis loop. Steam was sprayed onto the leak site to dampen the fire, which was brought under control 55 minutes later. Property damages included pipe insulation, the reactor's protective shutters, concrete fireproofing of the reactor structure, and instrumentation cables within 3 meters of the leak site. The flames did not affect the synthesis reactor itself, which was protected by a deflector. The incident was caused by inappropriate tightening torque applied to the bolts of the leaking flange, which was not adapted to the exceptional operating conditions when the incident occurred (i.e., a large temperature difference between the bolts and the flange due to the relatively short shutdown period).

Additional contributing factors included the following:	- Severe pipe corrosion due to the presence of hot water in the pipe trench	- Hydrogen piping located in a concealed space	- Limitations of the flash-fire-resistant garments worn by plant employees.Key findings noted in the CSB report included:	Significant accumulations of combustible iron powder fueled fatal flash fires when lofted near an ignition source.	Facility management were aware of the combustibility hazard two years earlier but did not mitigate the hazard with engineering controls or housekeeping.	The plant did not institute combustible gas monitoring or employee training to help avoid flammable gas fires and explosions.	OSHA did not include iron and steel mills in its Combustible Dust National Emphasis Program.	The 2006 International Fire Code (IFC) does not require enforcement of the more comprehensive and rigorous NFPA standards for the prevention of dust fires and explosions.	The state and city did not enforce recommended IFC practices.	The local fire department inspected the facility just months before the fatal hydrogen explosion and dust flash fire but did not cite or address the combustible dust hazards that were present.	The flame-resistant clothing provided to the plant employees did not adequately protect them from the hydrogen explosion and dust flash fires.	There was no corporate oversight regarding the management of combustible dusts even though there had been a succession of serious accidents at the facility in the past.The CSB made recommendations regarding combustible dust hazards to OSHA, the International Code Council, the state, the company, the Metal Powder Producers Association, the city, and the local fire department. Recommendations to the company covered both combustible dust and flammable gases as shown below.	Conduct periodic inspection audits of the facility for compliance with the relevant NFPA standards (484, 499, 497, 2, and 2113), using knowledgeable experts, and implement all recommended corrective actions.	Develop a training program for combustible dust hazards for all employees and contractors.	Implement a preventive maintenance program and leak detection/mitigation procedures for all flammable gas piping and gas processing equipment.	Implement a near-miss reporting and investigation policy.
除上述可能的原因外,缺乏氢气泄漏检测标准操作程序也是造成此次事故的可能原因之一。其他诱因包括： - 管沟中存在热水导致管道严重腐蚀 - 氢气管道位于隐蔽空间 - 工厂员工所穿的防闪光防火服存在局限性。CSB 报告中指出的主要发现包括：大量积聚的可燃铁粉悬浮在火源附近时会引发致命的闪火。工厂管理层早在两年前就意识到了可燃性危险,但没有通过工程控制或内务管理来减轻危险。工厂没有对可燃气体进行监控,也没有对员工进行培训,以帮助避免可燃气体火灾和爆炸。OSHA 没有将钢铁厂纳入其可燃粉尘国家重点计划。2006 年《国际消防法规》（IFC）没有要求执行更全面,更严格的 NFPA 标准,以防止粉尘火灾和爆炸。该州和该市并没有执行 IFC 推荐的做法。当地消防部门在致命的氢气爆炸和粉尘闪火发生前几个月检查了该设施,但并未指出或解决存在的可燃粉尘危险。为工厂员工提供的阻燃服不足以保护他们免受氢气爆炸和尘闪火灾的伤害。尽管该工厂过去曾连续发生过严重事故,但公司对可燃粉尘的管理缺乏监督。CSB 就可燃粉尘危害向职业安全与健康管理局,国际规范委员会,州政府,公司,金属粉末生产商协会,市政府和当地消防部门提出了建议。向该公司提出的建议涉及可燃粉尘和易燃气体,如下所示。利用知识渊博的专家对设施进行定期检查审核,以确保其符合相关的 NFPA 标准（484,499,497,2 和 2113）,并实施所有建议的纠正措施。为所有员工和承包商制定有关可燃粉尘危害的培训计划。对所有可燃气体管道和气体处理设备实施预防性维护计划和泄漏检测/缓解程序。实施险情报告和调查政策。","Operators in a powdered metals production facility heard a hissing noise near one of the plant furnaces and determined that it was a gas leak in the trench below the furnaces. The trench carried hydrogen, nitrogen, and cooling water runoff pipes as well as a vent pipe for the furnaces.

Maintenance personnel presumed that the leak was nonflammable nitrogen because there had recently been a nitrogen piping leak elsewhere in the plant. Using the plant's overhead crane, they removed some of the heavy trench covers. They determined that the leak was in an area that the crane could not reach, so they brought in a forklift with a chain to remove the trench covers in that area.

Eyewitnesses stated that as the first trench cover was wrenched from its position by the forklift, friction created sparks followed immediately by a powerful explosion. Several days after the explosion, Chemical Safety Board (CSB) investigators observed a large hole (~3x7 inches) in a corroded section of hydrogen vent piping inside the trench.

As the hydrogen-air mixture in the partially open trench exploded, the resulting overpressure dispersed large quantities of iron dust from the rafters and other surfaces in the plant, and some of this dust subsequently ignited. Eyewitnesses reported that embers were raining down and igniting iron dust flash fires in the area. Visibility was so poor due to dust and smoke that even with a flashlight, it was impossible to see more than 3 or 4 feet. Three plant employees eventually died from burn injuries despite wearing supposedly flash-fire-resistant garments. Two others suffered smoke-inhalation injuries. Due to the extensive nature of the injuries, and the abundance of both hydrogen and combustible dust present at the time of the incident, it is difficult to specifically determine which fuel, if not both, caused the fatal injuries to the victims.
一家粉末冶金生产厂的操作人员听到工厂的一个熔炉附近发出嘶嘶声,并确定是熔炉下面的沟槽发生了气体泄漏。该沟槽内有氢气,氮气和冷却水排水管以及熔炉的排气管。

维修人员推测泄漏的是不可燃的氮气,因为工厂其他地方最近也发生过氮气管道泄漏。他们用工厂的天车移开了一些沉重的沟槽盖板。他们确定泄漏是在起重机无法到达的区域,因此他们开来一辆带链条的叉车,将该区域的沟槽盖板移开。

目击者称,当第一块沟盖板被叉车从其位置上拽下来时,摩擦产生了火花,随即发生了强烈爆炸。爆炸发生数天后,化学安全委员会 (CSB) 的调查人员在坑道内被腐蚀的一段氢气排放管道上发现了一个大洞（约 3x7 英寸）。

当部分敞开的坑道中的氢气-空气混合物爆炸时,产生的超压使大量铁屑从厂房的椽子和其他表面飞散开来,其中一些灰尘随后被点燃。目击者报告说,余烬如雨点般落下,点燃了该地区的铁屑闪火。由于烟尘弥漫,能见度极低,即使打着手电筒,也不可能看到三四英尺以外的地方。尽管工厂里有三名员工穿着所谓的防闪火服装,但他们最终还是被烧伤致死。另有两名员工因吸入浓烟而受伤。由于受伤部位广泛,而且事发时存在大量氢气和可燃粉尘,因此很难具体确定哪种燃料（如果不是两种燃料）造成了受害者的致命伤。","(Spontaneous combustion)

A staff member was preparing to use the FTIR instrument. Prior to use of the instrument, it must be purged with dry nitrogen to remove residual carbon dioxide and water vapor. When the gas mixture reached the instrument's globar (resistively heated ceramic) heat source, a localized explosion occurred. No injuries resulted from the explosion but the spectrometer housing was heavily damaged. The internal components, including the optics and computer hardware, appeared to be in good shape.

运行期间","A hydrogen release of this type is a significant event. The event highlighted a number of procedural contributing factors that will influence the manner in which these fuel cell systems will be serviced in the future. A complicating factor in this event was that multiple companies were involved, and communications among them were inadequate. It is likely that the condition existed from the original manufacture of the fuel cell systems, and may even have been understood by the Company A fuel cell team, but the history is not fully known since that team no longer exists. Company B’s investigation also discovered that a similar leak had been experienced at the same facility and a similar replacement had been required, but there was no corporate memory of the repair or the underlying failure mode.If a situation arises as a result of consolidation or equipment transfer wherein another entity takes ownership or service and support responsibility for fuel cell systems, the full design history and operating records of the systems must be fully documented and accessible. This will allow for proper knowledge transfer of underlying design considerations or problematic reliability or safety-related issues, and potentially prevent this type of avoidable incident from occurring again.Another lesson relates to how high-pressure components within the hydrogen fuel storage system are qualified following a repair. It is envisioned that in the near future, there will likely be regional service centers equipped with re-manufacturing capabilities to support commercial fuel cell deployments. These repair shops would be equipped with the infrastructure to properly purge and pressurize equipment with small-molecule gas to test for leaks.
这种类型的氢气释放是一个重大事件。这次事件凸显了一些程序上的促成因素,这些因素将影响今后对这些燃料电池系统进行维修的方式。这次事件的一个复杂因素是涉及到多家公司,而它们之间的沟通不足。这种情况很可能在最初生产燃料电池系统时就已经存在,A 公司的燃料电池团队甚至可能已经了解这种情况,但由于该团队已不复存在,因此无法完全了解其历史。B 公司在调查中还发现,同一工厂也曾发生过类似的泄漏,并需要进行类似的更换,但公司对维修或基本故障模式没有任何记忆。如果因合并或设备转让而出现另一实体拥有燃料电池系统所有权或承担服务和支持责任的情况,则必须完整记录并提供系统的完整设计历史和运行记录。这将允许对基本设计考虑或有问题的可靠性或安全性相关问题进行适当的知识转移,并有可能防止此类可避免的事件再次发生。另一个教训与氢燃料储存系统内的高压部件在维修后如何进行鉴定有关。根据设想,在不久的将来,很可能会出现具备再制造能力的区域服务中心,以支持商业燃料电池的部署。这些维修店将配备基础设施,用小分子气体对设备进行适当的吹扫和加压,以测试是否有泄漏。","A significant hydrogen leak occurred during refueling of the onboard hydrogen storage tank of a fuel cell-powered lift truck while it was completely depowered. The in-tank shutoff solenoid valve had recently been replaced, and this was the initial refueling event after the replacement. The fuel zone access panel was removed to allow constant visual leak checking with Snoop leak-detection fluid. The event occurred during the final pressure testing of the repaired system when an O-ring failed at approximately 4500 psi, releasing the entire contents of the hydrogen tank in about 10 minutes. The dispenser hose/nozzle was immediately disconnected, and the leak location was quickly isolated to the tank/valve interface. A 30-foot boundary around the lift truck was cleared of personnel and equipment. The combustible gas detector mounted on the wall above the hydrogen dispenser did not alarm because a large overhead facility fan was providing ventilation throughout the event. The leaking hydrogen did not ignite, no one was injured, and there was no property damage as a result of this event.

The fuel cell systems for the lift trucks were originally built by Company A and placed into service in 2009. Company B assumed the service and support responsibilities in 2011, and then subcontracted the service labor to Company C. The only instructions given to Company C regarding the tank valve and the O-ring were to follow the tank valve manufacturer’s torque specification for ensuring a seal.

Shortly after this event occurred, an investigation was undertaken by Company B. Company C reported that the O-ring was clean, lubricated, and tight when installed. However, after removing the failed tank and valve from the lift truck for investigation, it was noted that there was insufficient insertion depth of the in-tank solenoid valve, and the O-ring was not able to provide a sufficient seal due to inadequate compression at the tank/valve interface. This situation was caused by the internal thread of the tank that did not allow full engagement at the specified tank manufacturer’s torque requirement, and this geometric discrepancy was confirmed by comparison with a new tank that had been purchased as a spare. The investigation revealed that the tank threads were modified on other tanks of this same model, but not on the specific tank involved in this event. Thus, the tank would have required substantially more torque than provided to fully compress the O-ring as intended (i.e., much more than the manufacturer’s recommended torque specification).

Information regarding the difficulties in original manufacturing and the later modification of tank threads to attain a proper seal was not transferred from Company A to Company B, and the Company A fuel cell team had since been disbanded. The tank supplier has begun modifying its tanks to accommodate the valve, so newer batches are in compliance, while the earlier systems require the higher torque to ensure a good seal.
在对一辆燃料电池升降车的车载储氢罐进行重新加氢时,发生了严重的氢气泄漏,当时升降车已完全失去动力。储氢罐内的关闭电磁阀最近更换过,这是更换后的首次加氢。燃料区检修板被拆除,以便使用 Snoop 检漏液进行持续的目视检漏。事件发生在对修复后的系统进行最后的压力测试期间,当时一个 O 形环在大约 4500 psi 的压力下失效,在大约 10 分钟内释放了氢气罐中的所有内容物。分配器软管/喷嘴被立即断开,泄漏位置很快被隔离到氢气罐/阀门接口处。在升降车周围 30 英尺的范围内清除了人员和设备。安装在氢气分配器上方墙壁上的可燃气体探测器没有报警,因为在整个事件过程中,头顶上的大型设施风扇一直在提供通风。泄漏的氢气没有被点燃,没有人员受伤,也没有财产损失。

升降车的燃料电池系统最初由 A 公司制造,并于 2009 年投入使用。B 公司于 2011 年承担了服务和支持责任,然后将服务工作分包给了 C 公司。就储罐阀和 O 形圈向 C 公司发出的唯一指示是,按照储罐阀制造商的扭矩规格确保密封。

事件发生后不久,B 公司进行了调查。C 公司报告说,O 形环在安装时是清洁,润滑和紧固的。但是,从叉车上拆下故障罐体和阀门进行调查后发现,罐内电磁阀的插入深度不够,由于罐体/阀门接口处的压缩力不足,O 形环无法提供足够的密封。造成这种情况的原因是油箱的内部螺纹无法按照油箱制造商规定的扭矩要求完全啮合,通过与作为备用油箱购买的新油箱进行比较,证实了这一几何差异。调查显示,同型号的其他罐体的罐体螺纹经过了修改,但此次事件中的特定罐体没有。因此,罐体需要比提供的扭矩大得多的扭矩才能按预期完全压缩 O 形环（即比制造商建议的扭矩规格大得多）。A 公司没有向 B 公司传递有关原始生产中的困难以及后来为达到适当密封而修改储气罐螺纹的信息,而且 A 公司的燃料电池小组后来也解散了。油箱供应商已开始修改其油箱以适应阀门,因此较新的批次符合要求,而较早的系统则需要更大的扭矩以确保良好的密封。","(Spontaneous combustion)

Investigators found no external signs of a fire, but the forklift would not start. The fuel cell power pack access panel was removed to enable investigators to search for any internal signs of a fire. Some areas inside the fuel cell stack appeared to have experienced an electrical arc or some type of overheating. All connections were verified to be tight and secure. The internal fuel cell stack circuit board cover was then removed, and the circuit card on top of the stack also showed signs of overheating. After the fuel cell stack circuit board was removed, a broken drill bit was discovered on top of the fuel cell stack plates.Evidently, the drill bit was jostled around when the forklift was operated, causing a spark and fire inside the fuel cell stack that burned the circuit card. It is unclear how the drill bit got where it was on top of the fuel cell stack plates. Records indicated that there had not been any maintenance performed on this fuel cell pack that would require drilling. In addition, an inventory check of technician tools used for fuel cell stack assembly accounted for all drill bits.

The initial investigation did not reveal any obvious signs of an ignition source in the vicinity of the forklift operation. The on-board data acquisition system did not indicate any abnormalities in the operating parameters of the fuel cell system (e.g., temperature, pressure, voltage, current). The fuel cell was disassembled, but no evidence was found of any electrical shorts or other potential ignition sources. Thus it was concluded that the fuel cell unit itself was not the ignition source for this incident.One theory presented the possibility of a spark (caused by static electricity) being the source of the ignition that caused the fire. Due to the proximity of the fuel cell unit to a shrink-wrap packaging machine at the time of the incident, this seemed to be a plausible hypothesis. However, sparking tests on evaporator pad materials failed to confirm this, and it seems highly unlikely that a wet evaporator pad would ignite from static electricity. The true ignition source for this incident remains unknown.After the initial investigation, the company used a hydrogen meter to monitor hydrogen levels near the evaporator pad during fuel cell start-up (which they expected to be the highest, due to a system purge). They also wanted to investigate if hydrogen could become trapped near the vent covering the evaporator pad. The tests indicated hydrogen levels well below the lower flammability limit (0.022%). Similar readings were also detected from the exhaust on the other make/model fuel cells operating in the facility. They detected no sign that high levels of hydrogen were trapped near the vent of any fuel cell make/model.
火灾烧毁了蒸发器垫,并导致塑料蒸发器垫支架变形,其根本原因尚不清楚。初步调查没有发现叉车作业附近有任何明显的火源迹象。车载数据采集系统没有显示燃料电池系统的运行参数（如温度,压力,电压,电流）有任何异常。对燃料电池进行了拆卸,但没有发现任何电气短路或其他潜在火源的迹象。因此得出结论,燃料电池装置本身并不是此次事故的点火源。有一种理论认为,火花（由静电引起）可能是导致火灾的点火源。由于事发时燃料电池装置靠近一台收缩包装机,这一假设似乎是可信的。然而,对蒸发器垫材料进行的火花测试未能证实这一点,湿蒸发器垫因静电而起火的可能性很小。这起事故的真正点火源仍然未知。经过初步调查后,该公司使用氢气测量仪监测燃料电池启动时蒸发器垫附近的氢气含量（由于系统吹扫,他们预计氢气含量最高）。他们还想研究氢气是否会在覆盖蒸发器垫的通风口附近滞留。测试表明,氢气含量远低于可燃性下限（0. 022%）。在该设施中运行的其他品牌/型号的燃料电池的排气中也检测到了类似的读数。他们没有发现任何燃料电池品牌/型号的排气口附近存在高浓度氢气的迹象。","The evaporator pad in a fuel cell power unit installed in a hydrogen-powered forklift caught fire during operation.

The upper left corner of the fuel cell evaporator pad was burned entirely; the plastic bracket that holds the evaporator pad in place was distorted; there was some discoloration of the radiator. No injuries were sustained by the operator and no damage was sustained by the forklift.

运行期间","Based on the results of the company investigation and analysis of an amateur video, the company determined that the incident could have been caused by the failure of one of the following plant components:	· pipes leading to the reactor pressure gauges	· the recycled quench gas pipe at the bottom of the reactor	· the diathermic oil pipe (hot oil) entering or exiting the heat exchanger	· the heat exchanger flanged joints and connection lines.The company determined that a release from the hot oil circuit could not have triggered the fire, based on the evidence from the pressure data in the circuit, which showed that the failure occurred 30 minutes after the fire started. The video confirms the pipe rupture 30 minutes after the fire began. For the same reason, a release from the hydrogen pipes is not considered likely, as the records demonstrate that the hydrogen pipe failed seven minutes after the fire began. When the heat exchanger flanged joints were dismantled, it was seen that the joint gaskets were not damaged. Thus, the company considers the failure of a pipe from the reactor pressure measurement gauges to be the most likely cause of the accident (although there is no conclusive evidence to identify the specific failure that caused the pipe to rupture). This assumption is supported by the following facts:	· This pipe is located in the area corresponding to the epicenter of the fire.	· The area corresponds to the area visually identified by the witnesses.	· The product release (hydrogen and fuel oil) from one of these pipes can cause a 6-meter long jet flame, as occurred.	· The product supposedly released would have had a high enough temperature and pressure to self-ignite or ignite against a plant hot spot (e.g., the hot oil circuit).	· The damages recorded were caused by overheating (flame exposition) and were not caused by overpressure or explosion. The pressure measurement records confirm no significant pressure changes at the beginning of the event.The company decided to rebuild the hydrotreatment plant, in compliance with regulations, and to introduce the following process design changes:	· complete separation of the light fuel oil section and the heavy fuel oil section to avoid the possibility of ""domino effects""	· lowering the maximum height of the heat exchanger installations from 25 meters to 15 meters to facilitate fire-extinguishing operations	· redesign of the piping system to minimize adjacencies	· relocation of the valves on the hydrogen quench line to enable depressurization	· reduction of the number of measurement gauges	· insertion of valves in a safe area for depressurizing the hot oil circuit.
根据公司的调查结果和对一段业余录像的分析,公司确定事故可能是由以下工厂部件之一的故障引起的：--通向反应堆压力表的管道--反应堆底部的循环淬火气管--进出热交换器的二热油管（热油）--热交换器法兰接头和连接管线。该公司确定,热油回路的泄漏不可能引发火灾,其依据是回路中的压力数据证据,该数据显示故障发生在火灾开始后 30 分钟。视频证实管道在起火 30 分钟后破裂。出于同样的原因,氢气管道泄漏的可能性也不大,因为记录显示氢气管道在起火 7 分钟后发生故障。在拆除热交换器法兰接头时,可以看到接头垫片没有损坏。因此,该公司认为反应堆压力测量仪表的管道故障是事故的最可能原因（尽管没有确凿证据确定导致管道破裂的具体故障）。这一假设得到了以下事实的支持：- 这根管道位于火灾震中的相应区域。- 该区域与目击者目测到的区域一致。- 从这些管道中释放出的产品（氢气和燃料油）可导致 6 米长的喷射火焰,正如所发生的那样。- 据称释放的产品具有足够高的温度和压力,可以自燃或在工厂热点（如热油回路）点燃。- 所记录的损坏是由过热（火焰暴露）造成的,而不是由超压或爆炸引起的。压力测量记录证实,在事件开始时压力没有明显变化。该公司决定按照规定重建加氢处理厂,并对工艺设计进行如下修改： - 将轻质燃料油部分和重质燃料油部分完全分开,以避免出现 ""多米诺效应 ""的可能性 - 将热交换器装置的最大高度从 25 米降低到 15 米,以方便灭火操作 - 重新设计管道系统,以尽量减少相邻关系 - 重新安置氢骤冷管线上的阀门,以实现减压 - 减少测量仪表的数量 - 在安全区域安装阀门,以实现热油回路的减压。","The incident occurred in the catalytic hydrotreatment plant of an oil refinery. The plant, which began operations in September 1997, has a capacity of 1650 tons/day of light fuel oil and 1450 tons/day of heavy fuel oil. The plant was designed to desulfurize the light and heavy fuel oil fractions produced in the refinery by treating them with high-pressure hydrogen over a catalyst to remove sulfur (producing hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct). The plant has two heating/reaction/fractionating sections to treat the two fuel oil fractions, but a single gas purification and compression section for the recycled hydrogen gas.

The heavy fuel oil reactor feedstock from the vacuum distillation plant is sent to the heavy fuel oil treatment section through three pipelines equipped with flow control systems. Once the entrained water is eliminated, the feedstock is pre-heated and then transferred to the reaction section at a pressure of 60 bar. Before the feedstock enters the reactor, it is mixed with the hot recycled hydrogen and heated to optimal temperature for the catalytic reaction (on average 360°C) in the feedstock/hot oil heat exchanger. The reactor effluent, consisting of desulfurized fuel oil and a gas mixture, is cooled down and sent to a liquid-gas separator. The gas, which is mainly of hydrogen, is washed and purified to remove any hydrogen sulfide before being recycled. The desulfurized heavy fuel oil feeds a pre-stripping column, and the overhead stream from this column is sent to the stripping column in the light fuel oil section. The pre-stripped heavy fuel oil fraction is heated and sent to the main fractionating column, which separates the following products: non-condensable gas, virgin naphtha, light desulfurized fuel oil, and heavy desulfurized fuel oil. The light fuel oil is sent from the main fractionating column to a stripper, where any entrained heavier hydrocarbons and water are eliminated. The heavy fuel oil is cooled down and transferred to storage.

The incident occurred in the heavy fuel oil purification section, which includes the reactor, the feedstock /hot oil heat exchange train, the hydrogen injection (quench) piping, and the reactor control instrumentation. A jet fire affected the 3-inch hydrogen quench line, which ruptured after a six-minute exposure, resulting in ignition of the hydrogen. The shift personnel who were present in the plant at the time of the rupture testified that a strong hissing sound was heard for a few seconds, followed with the ignition of the released product, but there had not been any noticeable pressure changes (e.g., pressure waves). The shift foreman, who was standing on the main access ramp to the atmospheric distillation plant, testified that he saw the jet fire ignite from the top and propagate down (from approximately 18 meters above ground down to approximately 14 meters in the area between the heat exchangers and the reactor). The fire took a cylindrical form, affecting the above-mentioned equipment under the diathermic oil preheater. Approximately 30 minutes after the fire started, an 8-inch fuel pipe in the diathermic oil system ruptured and caused a subsequent ignition of the fuel oil product.

Immediately the shift foreman activated the onsite emergency plan and informed the gate guard to alert the fire brigade, which was done at 21:40. The onsite emergency response team during that shift consisted of 6 people: the shift manager in charge of emergency management, the gate guard responsible for external communications, and four firefighters from the plants that were involved in the incident. The team, assisted by other shift personnel (known as the operative team), participated from the beginning of the event in implementing the emergency response. The operative team consisted of 8 workers, including shift foremen, control room operators, and plant operators. Approximately three minutes after the fire started, the fire brigade from the nearest town (with 6 fire fighters) arrived onsite, followed by other nearby fire brigades (with a total of 50 firefighters). The fire was kept under control and evolved without noticeable changes until the valves were closed and the fuel was consumed, according to the facility's emergency response plan. The fire was extinguished at 1:20 (about 3 hours and 40 minutes after it started) and the state of emergency was called off by the fire brigade at 1:45.
事故发生在一家炼油厂的催化加氢处理厂。该厂于 1997 年 9 月开始运营,每天可生产 1650 吨轻质燃油和 1450 吨重质燃油。该厂的设计目的是对炼油厂生产的轻质和重质燃料油馏分进行脱硫处理,方法是在催化剂上使用高压氢气对其进行脱硫处理（副产品为硫化氢）。该厂有两个加热/反应/分馏部分处理两种燃料油馏分,但只有一个气体净化和压缩部分处理回收的氢气。

来自真空蒸馏厂的重油反应器原料通过三条配备流量控制系统的管道输送到重油处理区。去除夹带的水分后,原料经过预热,然后在 60 巴的压力下被输送到反应段。在原料进入反应器之前,先与热的回收氢混合,并在原料/热油热交换器中加热到催化反应的最佳温度（平均 360°C）。反应器流出物由脱硫燃油和混合气体组成,冷却后送入液气分离器。气体的主要成分是氢气,经过洗涤和净化以去除硫化氢,然后再循环利用。脱硫后的重质燃油进入预脱硫塔,该塔的顶流则被送入轻质燃油区的脱硫塔。预脱除的重质燃料油馏分被加热后送入主分馏塔,分离出以下产品：不凝性气体,原生石脑油,轻质脱硫燃料油和重质脱硫燃料油。轻质燃料油从主分馏塔送入汽提塔,在汽提塔中去除所有夹带的重碳氢化合物和水。重质燃油冷却后被转移到储油库。

事故发生在重油净化部分,其中包括反应器,原料/热油热交换系统,氢气注入（淬火）管道和反应器控制仪表。喷射火焰影响到 3 英寸氢气骤冷管线,该管线在暴露 6 分钟后破裂,导致氢气被点燃。据破裂时在场的值班人员证实,当时听到了几秒钟强烈的嘶嘶声,随后释放出的产品被点燃,但没有任何明显的压力变化（如压力波）。当时站在常压蒸馏厂主要通道斜坡上的当班领班作证说,他看到喷射火从顶部燃起并向下蔓延（从离地面约 18 米处向下蔓延至热交换器和反应堆之间约 14 米处）。火势呈圆柱形,影响到二热油预热器下的上述设备。起火约 30 分钟后,二热油系统中的一根 8 英寸燃料管破裂,随后引燃了燃料油产品。

当班领班立即启动了现场应急预案,并通知门卫向消防队报警,报警时间为 21:40。当班的现场应急小组由 6 人组成：负责应急管理的当班经理,负责对外联络的门卫和来自事故所涉工厂的 4 名消防员。该小组在其他当班人员（称为行动小组）的协助下,从事件一开始就参与实施应急措施。操作小组由 8 名工人组成,包括轮班领班,控制室操作员和工厂操作员。起火约三分钟后,最近的镇消防队（6 名消防员）赶到现场,随后附近的其他消防队（共 50 名消防员）也赶到现场。根据该设施的应急计划,火势得到了控制,火势没有发生明显变化,直到阀门关闭,燃料消耗殆尽。大火于 1 时 20 分（起火后约 3 小时 40 分钟）被扑灭,消防队于 1 时 45 分宣布解除紧急状态。","(Spontaneous combustion)

运行期间","1.  Combustible gas detectors calibrated for hydrogen can falsely report hydrogen alarms due the presence of other gases the detector may pick up, such as carbon monoxide from engine exhaust or other sources. Since this event occurred, two hydrogen-specific alarms have been installed at this facility to eliminate false hydrogen alarms.2.  A building's ventilation system can be a source of gases that can trigger a hydrogen alarm, especially a combustible gas detector used for hydrogen detection. In this case, there were multiple sources of non-hydrogen gases that likely triggered the hydrogen alarm. A boiler needing maintenance that was operating near the building ventilation inlet was a possible source of non-hydrogen gas getting into the building, and it has subsequently undergone repairs to minimize the likelihood of it being a gas source. The loading dock that is partially inside of the building is used to start equipment like snow-blowers during cold weather and is also a possible gas source. Finally, when the fire department arrived with 15 fire vehicles operating near the building for 4 hours, some of the exhaust gases were likely sucked into the building ventilation system as the hydrogen alarms continued to alarm even though all the hydrogen bottles had been removed from the building by order of the fire department after the first alarm response.3.  Hydrogen storage capacity must meet storage regulations as defined by various agencies, including OSHA. Subsequent investigation by OSHA after this event found a violation in the building construction related to the 3,000 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen being stored in ten 300-CF bottles. One cubic foot less of hydrogen storage capacity would have complied with the OSHA hydrogen storage standard for this construction type (reference OSHA regulation 1910.103(b)(2)(ii)(c) Table H-2, that has three storage capacities: less than 3,000 CF, 3,000-15,000 CF, and in excess of 15,000 CF). In this event, the building did not meet the minimum distance in feet for 3,000 CF and greater hydrogen storage, so subsequently the storage capacity was reduced by the removal to two bottles to bring the hydrogen storage capacity under 3,000 CF.4.  Personnel should follow procedures for reporting hydrogen alarms to minimize outside personnel being unnecessary activated. Procedures in place for reporting hydrogen alarms had the following three levels of action: 1) for up to 10% of the LFL, the system is to be shut down and the Safety Department (on 24-hour call) notified, 2) for above 10% to 20% of the LFL, the premises are to be evacuated and the Safety Department notified, and 3) above 20% of the LFL, the fire department is to be called. Note that above 25% of the LFL, the alarm system automatically calls the fire department. In this event, the alarm levels were below 10% of the LFL, but the fire department was notified unnecessarily by the operating personnel. The research facility and other involved entities incurred additional expenses for emergency response that could have been avoided if reporting procedures had been followed.
1.   针对氢气校准的可燃气体探测器可能会误报氢气警报,因为探测器可能会捕捉到其他气体,如发动机排气或其他来源的一氧化碳。自该事件发生后,该设施安装了两个氢气专用报警器,以消除错误的氢气报警。2.   建筑物的通风系统可能是触发氢气警报的气体来源,尤其是用于氢气检测的可燃气体探测器。在本案例中,有多种非氢气源可能触发氢气警报。在大楼通风口附近运行的一台需要维护的锅炉可能是非氢气进入大楼的一个来源,随后对其进行了维修,将其成为气体来源的可能性降至最低。部分位于大楼内部的装卸区在寒冷天气时用于启动吹雪机等设备,也可能是一个气源。最后,当消防队到达时,15 辆消防车在大楼附近运行了 4 个小时,部分废气很可能被吸入大楼通风系统,因为氢气警报仍在继续报警,尽管在第一次报警后,消防队已下令将所有氢气瓶从大楼移走。3.   氢气储存能力必须符合包括职业安全和健康管理局在内的各机构规定的储存要求。事件发生后,职业安全与健康管理局（OSHA）进行了后续调查,发现该建筑的结构存在违规行为,即在 10 个 300 立方英尺的瓶子中储存了 3000 立方英尺（CF）的氢气。少一立方英尺的氢气储存量就能符合职业安全和健康管理局对该建筑类型的氢气储存标准（参考职业安全和健康管理局法规 1910. 103(b)(2)(ii)(c)表 H-2,其中规定了三种储存容量：小于 3,000 立方英尺,3,000-15,000 立方英尺和超过 15,000 立方英尺）。在此事件中,该建筑物不符合 3,000 CF 及以上氢气储存的最小距离（英尺）,因此随后将储存容量减少到两个瓶子,使氢气储存容量低于 3,000 CF。4.   4. 工作人员应遵守氢气警报报告程序,以尽量减少外部人员不必要的启动。现有的氢气警报报告程序包括以下三个级别的行动： 1) 如果氢气含量不超过 LFL 的 10%,则关闭系统并通知安全部（24 小时待命）；2) 如果氢气含量超过 LFL 的 10%至 20%,则疏散厂房并通知安全部；3) 如果氢气含量超过 LFL 的 20%,则呼叫消防部门。请注意,超过 LFL 的 25% 时,警报系统会自动呼叫消防部门。在这一事件中,警报级别低于 LFL 的 10%,但操作人员却不必要地通知了消防部门。研究机构和其他相关实体因应急响应产生了额外的费用,而如果遵守报告程序,这些费用是可以避免的。","Hydrogen alarms went off in a research laboratory and the fire department was called, but no hydrogen leak was detected. The hydrogen system was leak-checked with helium and found to be leak-free except for a very small leak in the manifold area. The manifold leak was fixed, but because of its small size, it was not thought to be the likely source for the hydrogen alarm trigger. While hydrogen was removed from the system for leak-testing, the hydrogen alarm went off again, and again the fire department responded. There was no hydrogen present in the system to trigger this alarm. Other sources within the building were checked to see what may have set off the alarm, but none were found. One research area uses small amounts of hydrogen, but laboratory logs indicate that none was being used at the time the alarm sounded. Carbon monoxide was also being investigated as a possible alarm trigger. The cause for the alarm has not yet been determined, but the investigation continues. There were no injuries or property damage associated with this event.

The research laboratory used hydrogen to create a very pure flame for a lathe to create fiber optic cables. The pure flame is important for the vapor deposition process used in the creation of the fiber optic cables. Hydrogen cylinders (ten 300-cubic foot cylinders for a total of 3,000 cubic feet or 85,950 liters) are located on the first floor, joined together by a manifold, and then piped for use on the 5th floor of the building. A hydrogen leak-detection system with alarms is located along the hydrogen path from the manifold to the point of use. The detectors used are combustible gas detectors that are calibrated for hydrogen.
一个研究实验室的氢气警报器响了,消防部门接到报警,但没有发现氢气泄漏。用氦气对氢气系统进行了检漏,发现除了在歧管区域有一个非常小的泄漏外,其他地方都没有泄漏。歧管泄漏已被修复,但由于泄漏量很小,因此认为它不可能是触发氢气警报的源头。在从系统中取出氢气进行泄漏测试时,氢气警报再次响起,消防部门再次做出反应。系统中没有氢气,因此没有触发警报。我们检查了大楼内的其他源头,看看是什么触发了警报,但没有发现任何源头。一个研究区域使用了少量氢气,但实验室记录显示,警报响起时没有使用氢气。一氧化碳也可能是触发警报的原因之一。警报原因尚未确定,但调查仍在继续。此次事件未造成人员伤亡或财产损失。

研究实验室使用氢气为车床制造光纤电缆创造了非常纯净的火焰。纯净的火焰对制造光缆时使用的气相沉积工艺非常重要。氢气钢瓶（10 个 300 立方英尺的钢瓶,总容量为 3,000 立方英尺或 85,950 升）位于一楼,通过一个汇流排连接在一起,然后通过管道输送到大楼五楼使用。从分流板到使用点的氢气管道上都安装了带警报器的氢气泄漏检测系统。使用的探测器是经过氢气校准的可燃气体探测器。","(Spontaneous combustion)
